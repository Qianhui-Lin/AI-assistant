Research Regulations\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPOSTGRADUATE RESEARCH REGULATIONS\\nPR 1 RESEARCH AWARDS\\nPR 1.1 The University currently offers the following awards (see Appendix 1 of these\\nRegulations for definitions of these awards):\\nDoctor of Science/Letters (DSc/DLitt)\\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD - via publication, single volume or multi-part thesis, including\\nEuropean, integrated and professional variants)\\nDoctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy)\\nDoctor of Engineering (EngD)\\nDoctor of Management (DMgt)\\nDoctor of Medicine (MD)\\nMaster of Philosophy (MPhil)\\nMaster of Arts, Law or Science by Research (LLM/MA/MSc by Research)\\nMaster of Research (MRes) (see below)\\nPR 1.2 The University categorises the Master of Research (MRes) as a postgraduate research\\ndegree award. Such programmes are, however, governed by the regulations for\\npostgraduate taught programmes for the purposes of assessment and classification, and\\nas such the MRes is included within the Postgraduate Taught Assessment Regulations.\\nPR 2 PHD REGULATIONS\\n[Unless otherwise specified in Appendix 3: Regulations for Specific Doctoral Awards or Programmes,\\nthe following regulations for the award of PhD also apply to other doctoral awards.]\\nPR 2.1 CRITERIA FOR THE AWARD\\nPR 2.1.1 The degree shall be awarded on the examination of a thesis embodying the results of a\\ncandidate's research, and on an oral examination. The nature of the student's research\\nprogramme should be on a scale which should be completed during three years, or at\\nmost four years, of full-time study or equivalent. In addition the candidate may be\\nrequired to undertake such other tests as the examiners may decide.\\nPR 2.1.2 A successful candidate for the degree of PhD shall show convincing evidence of the\\ncapacity to pursue scholarly research or scholarship in their field of study on a scale\\nwhich should be completed during three years of full-time research. The results of this\\nresearch shall then be embodied in a thesis which makes an original contribution to\\nknowledge and the completed thesis must contain material of a standard appropriate\\nVersion 1.1 3\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nfor scholarly publication. The thesis shall comply with the requirements for the form,\\nsubmission and deposit of theses.\\nPR 2.1.3 A successful candidate for the degree of PhD should be able to demonstrate:\\n(a) an ability to conceptualise, design and implement a major project for the\\ngeneration of significant new knowledge, applications and/or understanding,\\nusing appropriate concepts and methods, where necessary adapting these to\\nmeet unforeseen issues;\\n(b) a systematic acquisition of, and insight into, a substantial body of knowledge\\nincluding the primary literature in their particular area of interest;\\n(c) an ability to relate theory and concepts to evidence in a systematic way and to\\ndraw appropriate conclusions based on the evidence;\\n(d) critical investigation of their research topic resulting in the creation and\\ninterpretation of knowledge which extends the forefront of their discipline\\nthrough original research;\\n(e) a detailed understanding of, and ability to use, applicable techniques for\\nresearch and advanced inquiry in their field;\\n(f) that they can make informed judgements on complex issues in their field, often\\nin the absence of complete data;\\n(g) that the research is of publishable quality and is of a standard which satisfies\\npeer review;\\n(h) that they are competent as an independent researcher in their discipline and\\ncapable of continuing to undertake research at an advanced level, contributing\\nsubstantially to the development of new techniques, ideas or approaches;\\n(i) an understanding of the place of the research in the wider context;\\n(j) an ability to recognise the limitations of the research undertaken and to be able\\nto suggest ways of overcoming these in future research;\\n(k) an ability to write clearly and effectively and to meet approved criteria for\\nformal presentation of a written thesis;\\n(l) the qualities and transferable skills necessary for employment requiring\\npersonal responsibility and autonomous initiative in complex and often\\nunpredictable situations;\\n(m) the ability to communicate their ideas and conclusions clearly and effectively to\\nspecialist and non-specialist audiences.\\nPR 2.2 REGISTRATION PERIOD\\nPR 2.2.1 For full-time students the minimum period of registration for the degree shall normally\\nbe thirty-six calendar months from the date of commencement of studies to the date of\\nVersion 1.1 4\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nsubmission of the thesis. The maximum period of registration shall be forty-eight\\nmonths. Full-time students may, with the approval of the body or officer with delegated\\nauthority from Senate, be permitted to register for a shorter period, as proposed by the\\nadmitting department. A shorter period of registration, which may in no case be for a\\nperiod of less than twelve months, may be justified by recognising the applicant’s\\nattainment in original research prior to application and not otherwise accredited for a\\ndegree already awarded. Normally an extension beyond the maximum period of\\nregistration will not be permitted, but can be at the discretion of the body or officer with\\ndelegated authority from Senate.\\nPR 2.2.2 For part-time students the minimum period of registration for the degree shall normally\\nbe forty-eight calendar months from the date of commencement of studies to the date\\nof submission of the thesis. The maximum period of registration shall be eighty-four\\nmonths. Part-time students may, with the approval of the body or officer with\\ndelegated authority from Senate, be permitted to register for a shorter period, as\\nproposed by the admitting department. A shorter period of registration, which may in\\nno case be for a period of less than twenty-four months, may be justified by recognising\\nthe applicant’s attainment in original research prior to application and not otherwise\\naccredited for a degree already awarded. Normally an extension beyond the maximum\\nperiod of registration will not be permitted, but can be at the discretion of the body or\\nofficer with delegated authority from Senate.\\nPR 2.2.3 Where a student changes mode of study, the duration of their remaining study will be\\ncalculated using a full-time study to part-time study ratio of 1:1.75, rounding up to the\\nnearest month.\\nPR 2.2.4 In the event of an extension request being refused, PGR students have the right to\\nappeal to the relevant faculty Associate Dean with a final appeal to the University\\nAcademic Dean.\\nPR 2.3 SCHEDULE OF WORK\\nPR 2.3.1 Upon registration each student will be assigned a minimum of one main supervisor, who\\nwill normally be part of a supervisory team.\\nPR 2.3.2 The nature of the student’s research programme should be on a scale which should be\\ncompleted during three years, or at most four years, of full-time study or equivalent.\\nPR 2.3.3 The supervisor(s) and student should agree a realistic completion timetable which will\\nenable the student to produce a thesis of the required standard within the stipulated\\ntime-scale. The supervisor(s) and student will agree milestones throughout this\\nschedule against which progress will be monitored. Progress is monitored through\\nappraisal meetings between the supervisor(s) and student. Further details of the\\nappraisal process may be found in the University’s Code of Practice on Postgraduate\\nResearch Programmes.\\nVersion 1.1 5\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nPR 2.4 PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS\\nYear 1 (year 2 part-time)\\nPR 2.4.1 Within the first six months all research students must fulfil the following, or an\\nequivalent, process:\\n(a) attend an approved induction programme;\\n(b) carry out an approved development needs analysis (DNA) or equivalent in\\nconsultation with their supervisors, and keep a record of agreed follow-up to the\\nDNA;\\n(c) take the appropriate research training activities, informed by the DNA as guided\\nby their supervisors;\\n(d) complete a research proposal or plan of work which the supervisors approve as\\nappropriate and viable;\\n(e) complete the mandatory Research Integrity and Ethical Research training;\\n(f) agree any additional training that may be required;\\n(g) agree a projected completion timetable with their supervisors; and\\n(h) any additional requirements to meet the particular needs of the individual\\nawards.\\nPR 2.4.2 Any research student who does not demonstrate satisfactory progress during the first six\\nmonths full-time should be: carefully monitored and supported, informed about any\\nreasons for concern, set objectives, and their progress reviewed before the twelve-\\nmonth deadline. If their progress is still not satisfactory they will be referred to the\\nStanding Academic Committee by the academic department with a recommendation for\\nexclusion from the programme. Students who have been excluded for failing to make\\nsatisfactory progress may appeal against the exclusion under the Academic Appeals\\nprocedures as defined in the chapter on Academic Appeals.\\nPR 2.4.3 Confirmation of PhD status, where appropriate, may be conferred at this stage in\\naccordance with the procedures (see PR 2.5 below).\\nPR 2.4.4 It is the responsibility of the student and supervisor to identify whether ethical approval\\nis required for any part of the research.1 If it is, then no research requiring ethical\\napproval can be conducted before ethical approval has been granted by the Faculty\\nResearch Ethics Committee.\\n1 Students and Supervisors should consult the guidance on Research Ethics, or consult their Faculty Ethics\\nCommittee to determine whether ethical approval is required.\\nVersion 1.1 6\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nYears 2 to 4 (or part-time equivalents)\\nPR 2.4.5 Continued registration of a student in years 2, 3 and 4 on the research component of a\\nPhD programme is conditional upon agreed criteria including:\\n(a) submission of an appraisal (progress) report, involving input from the student,\\nsupervisors and department;\\n(b) evidence, confirmed in the appraisal (progress) report, that the student has:\\n(i) attended the annual faculty-based progress briefing session;\\n(ii) reviewed/revised their DNA;\\n(iii) completed any additional training as agreed;\\n(iv) Confirmed that:\\n• Ethical approval for research has been obtained in writing via their\\nFaculty Research Ethics Committee;\\n• Ethical review is ongoing where research has not yet commenced; or\\n• Ethical approval is not required for the scope of the research and\\nthis has been explicitly confirmed in writing and recorded via the\\nappraisal form;\\n(v) been offered adequate supervision (as outlined in the University’s Code\\nof Practice for Research students), accepted it, and attended supervisory\\nsessions;\\n(vi) agreed a realistic completion timetable with their supervisors;\\n(vii) demonstrated sufficient progress with their research/thesis; and\\n(viii) any additional requirements previously agreed.\\nPR 2.4.6 Where students fail to meet the criteria for continued registration they will be referred\\nto the Standing Academic Committee by the academic department with a\\nrecommendation for exclusion from the programme. Students who have been excluded\\nfor failing to make satisfactory progress may appeal against the exclusion under the\\nprocedures for Academic Appeals as defined in the chapter on Academic Appeals.\\nPR 2.4.7 During the first six months of the second year (or part-time equivalents) any student\\nwhose PhD registration has not yet been confirmed will be referred to the PhD\\nConfirmation Panel (see PR 2.5.3 below).\\nPR 2.5 CONFIRMATION OF PHD STATUS\\nPR 2.5.1 Each programme/department shall publish clear information for students, approved by\\nfaculty, on the procedures for confirmation of PhD. A student supervised in more than\\none department shall follow the procedures used by the administrating department. The\\nmake-up of confirmation panels should be approved by the HoD or nominated deputy\\nVersion 1.1 7\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nwith suitable regard to avoid conflict of interest and the relevant experience and nature\\nof the academic contract of the nominated panellists.\\nPR 2.5.2 The published procedures should include details of:\\n(a) membership of the panel;\\n(b) volume, level and type of work to be submitted as evidence to the panel and\\njustified in terms of the nature of the PhD to be awarded;\\n(c) normal expected period in which a student should expect to have their PhD\\nregistration status confirmed, bearing in mind the mode of study, periods of\\nsuspension and any other relevant factors; and\\n(d) a maximum of two attempts is available for a student to be considered for\\nconfirmation of PhD status;\\n(e) the expectations of each panellist (supervisor, if present; chair, if present;\\nconfirmation panellists) in terms of their input and approach;\\n(f) information on which forms or procedures need to be completed and followed\\npre panel and post panel;\\n(g) how support for the student will be assessed.\\nWhile programmes/departments have some discretion in determining the above, where\\nthere is deviation from the following guidance, this must be explicitly approved by\\nfaculties:\\n(i) if, in exceptional circumstances, a confirmation panellist is also nominated as\\nthesis internal examiner, the HoD or nominated deputy, in signing off the thesis\\nsupervisor form, must consider that there is no material advantage or\\ndisadvantage to this for the student and the existing form will need to be\\nchanged to reflect this;\\n(ii) there should be at least one independent panellist (i.e. neither a supervisor or a\\nmember of staff currently acting as part of a student’s supervisory panel);\\n(iii) where a supervisor is present for the confirmation panel, at least part of the\\npanel discussion should take place without the supervisory team to enable\\ndiscussions around the suitability of the current supervisory approach;\\n(iv) where a second confirmation panel is required for a candidate, this must be\\nboth independently chaired and recorded;\\n(v) as with viva recordings, recordings are only available to students in case of\\nappeal.\\nThe first panel can either be recorded or independently chaired (i.e. the chair cannot be\\npart of the panel making the confirmation decision). Where there is no separate chair,\\none of the panellists should take on the role of the chair. Where a recording is being\\nused, students should be given the option to pause when they discuss their supervision\\nVersion 1.1 8\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nexperiences; this is also the case when supervisors discuss the candidate if the candidate\\nis not present.\\nPR 2.5.3 The PhD confirmation panel:\\n(a) must normally be held no later than eighteen months after initial registration\\n(twenty-four months for part-time) or entry into the research phase of a PhD\\nwith a previous taught component. Departments are responsible for ensuring\\nthe timely completion of the PhD Confirmation Panel. If the panel is held within\\ntwelve months of registration then the report of the panel should replace the\\nfirst year’s annual review report. Where a student’s PhD status is confirmed\\nafter twenty-four months have elapsed (thirty-six months part-time) from initial\\nregistration, they are liable for fees for a further twelve months from the date of\\nthe panel (pro rata for part-time students);\\n(b) must see and approve evidence that the student has: attended induction,\\ncarried out the Development Needs Analysis (DNA), completed the mandatory\\nResearch Integrity and Ethical Research training,2 attended any additional\\nagreed training, devised a viable research proposal, made appropriate progress\\non ethical approval requirements prior to commencing any research, and a\\ncompletion timetable approved by their supervisors;\\n(c) must be able to confirm that the student’s work is of appropriate quality and\\nstandard, and the project is viable within the registration period, on the basis of\\ndraft chapters and/or evidence of data gathered; and\\n(d) will have four possible recommendations – confirm as PhD; continue as a\\nprobationary PhD student; transfer to MPhil; exclusion.\\nPR 2.5.4 Students not successful in receiving confirmation of PhD status may appeal against the\\nrecommendation under the procedures for Academic Appeals as defined in the chapter\\non Academic Appeals.\\nPR 2.6 SUBMISSION OF THESIS\\nPR 2.6.1 The decision to submit a thesis for examination is taken by the student, although the\\nopinion of the supervisor should be considered.\\nPR 2.6.2 A candidate shall make a declaration that the thesis is their own work and has not been\\nsubmitted by this candidate in substantially the same form for the award of a higher\\ndegree elsewhere. Any sections of the thesis which have been published, or submitted\\nfor a higher degree elsewhere, shall be clearly identified. If the thesis is, in whole or in\\npart, the result of joint research, a statement indicating the nature of the candidate’s\\ncontribution to that research shall be included, confirmed by either the supervisor(s), or\\nthe principal author of the material(s) accepted for publication.\\n2 For the avoidance of doubt, a student cannot be confirmed as a PhD candidate without having completed\\nboth the Research Integrity and Ethical Research training.\\nVersion 1.1 9\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nPR 2.6.3 A candidate shall also make a declaration that either: ethical approval has been granted\\nfor the research presented, or that ethical approval was confirmed as not being\\nnecessary for the research presented.\\nPR 2.7 FORMAT OF THESIS\\nPR 2.7.1 A thesis for the degree of PhD shall not normally exceed 80,000 words (see Appendix 2\\nfor full details of specific material to be included and excluded within the word count).\\nA candidate, with the support of their supervisor, may apply for exceptional permission\\nto exceed the word limit, which approval may be granted by the body or officer with\\ndelegated authority from Senate.\\nPR 2.7.2 The thesis shall be written in English. A candidate, with the support of their supervisor\\nand Head of Department, may apply for exceptional permission to present the thesis in\\nwhole or in part in another language, and approval may be granted by the body or\\nofficer with delegated authority from Senate.\\nPR 2.7.3 Where agreed, a candidate for the degree of PhD may submit the thesis in any of the\\nfollowing formats:\\n(a) single volume written thesis;\\n(b) multi-part thesis comprised of articles or papers; and\\n(c) multimodal thesis comprised of written, and practical and/or creative elements.\\nSee Appendices 2 and 3 for further details and regulations relating to these formats.\\nNote: having received agreement to submit with a specific format, a student cannot opt\\nto subsequently switch between formats without having first secured further agreement\\nfrom their academic department.\\nPR 2.7.4 A copy of any thesis relating to the award of a research degree made by Lancaster\\nUniversity must be deposited with the University at the prescribed time. For details on\\nthe format of submission, see Appendix 2.\\nPR 2.8 EXAMINATION\\nPR 2.8.1 Examiners (including at least one External Examiner) shall be appointed by the body or\\nofficer with delegated authority from Senate on the nomination of the department(s)\\nconcerned (see PR 5: Appointment of Examiners (All Research Degrees)). Two External\\nExaminers shall be appointed for theses submitted by candidates who qualify for\\nremission of fees as members of staff, unless in exceptional circumstances the body or\\nofficer with delegated authority from Senate decides otherwise. The candidate's\\nsupervisor shall not act as an examiner.\\nPR 2.8.2 Each examiner shall report independently on the thesis before the oral, or any other\\nexamination required by the examiners, takes place and submit the report to the\\nUniversity prior to the examination. All examiners shall participate in the oral\\nexamination. The examiners may, at their discretion, invite the student's supervisor to\\nbe present at the oral examination. After the oral examination, each examiner shall\\nreport on the examination and make a recommendation based on both the report on\\nVersion 1.1 10\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nthe thesis and on the evidence from the oral, and any other examinations that have\\ntaken place.\\nPR 2.9 EXAMINATION OUTCOMES\\nPR 2.9.1 The examiners shall make one of the following recommendations. Where a time period\\nis specified for undertaking additional work on the thesis, this will commence from the\\ndate of notification of the decision by Student and Programme Administration.\\n(a) That the degree of PhD be awarded immediately: a pass with no corrections.\\n(b) That the degree of PhD be awarded immediately: a pass with very minor\\ncorrections, i.e. typographical or presentational corrections only. The candidate\\nis to make the very minor corrections required within one month prior to\\nsubmission of the final version of the thesis and there is no requirement for\\nthese to be approved by the internal or the external examiner.\\n(c) That the degree of PhD be awarded subject to minor amendments being made\\nwithin three months. ‘Minor amendments’ refers to e.g. a number of significant\\nstylistic errors such as needing to clarify or rephrase points, or add/edit blocks of\\ntext. There will be no requirement to conduct further research or to undertake\\nsubstantial further work. The amendments must be approved by the internal\\nexaminer. A second oral examination is not required.\\n(d) That the degree of PhD be awarded subject to major amendments being made\\nwithin six months: there is a requirement for significant further work, but there\\nis not a requirement for a second oral examination. Changes may include, but\\nare not limited to: the addition of substantial new material; rewriting and\\nediting sections of the thesis; re-analysis of existing data. The amendments\\nmust be approved by either the internal examiner or the internal and the\\nexternal examiner, as agreed by the examiners. A second oral examination is\\nnot required.\\n(e) That the degree of PhD should not be awarded but that the candidate should be\\npermitted to revise and resubmit the thesis within twelve months for the\\ndegree of PhD: the requirements for the degree of PhD have not been met.\\nChanges may include, but are not limited to: extensive rewriting and editing\\nsections of, or the whole of, the thesis; carrying out further research and/or\\nexperimental work. The revisions must be approved by both the internal and\\nthe external examiner. There is an expectation that a second viva will be held\\nbut the examiners can exceptionally discount this where they are satisfied that it\\nis not necessary.\\n(f) That the degree of MPhil be awarded immediately: the requirements for the\\ndegree of PhD have not been met but the requirements for the MPhil have been\\nmet, with no or very minor corrections, i.e. typographical or presentational\\ncorrections only. The candidate is to make very minor corrections, if required,\\nwithin one month prior to submission of the final version of the thesis and there\\nis no requirement for these to be approved by the internal or the external\\nexaminer.\\nVersion 1.1 11\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n(g) That the degree of MPhil be awarded subject to minor amendments being made\\nwithin three months: the requirements for the degree of PhD have not been\\nmet but the requirements for the MPhil have been met with minor\\namendments, e.g. a number of significant stylistic errors such as needing to\\nclarify or rephrase points, or add/edit blocks of text. There will be no\\nrequirement to conduct further research or to undertake substantial further\\nwork. The amendments must be approved by the internal examiner. A second\\noral examination is not required.\\n(h) That the candidate be permitted to revise and resubmit the thesis within twelve\\nmonths for the degree of MPhil: the requirements for the degree of PhD have\\nnot been met but the candidate is permitted to submit a revised thesis for the\\nlower award. Changes may include, but are not limited to: extensive editorial\\ncorrections and revisions; rewriting a part, parts, or the whole of the thesis;\\ncarrying out further research or experimental work. The revisions must be\\napproved by both the internal and the external examiner. The examiners will\\ndetermine if a second oral examination is required.\\nPR 2.9.2 Outcomes (f), (g) and (h) above are not available for the DClinPsy and MD programmes.\\nPR 2.9.3 Students may appeal against the outcome of the examination under the procedures for\\nAcademic Appeals as defined in the chapter on Academic Appeals.\\nPR 2.9.4 Students given the opportunity to make corrections or amendments shall normally be\\ngiven only one opportunity to make the changes required as specified by the examiners.\\nPR 2.9.5 Examiners' reports and recommendations will be considered by the body or officer with\\ndelegated authority from Senate on behalf of the Committee of the Senate.\\nPR 2.10 DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN EXAMINERS ON FIRST SUBMISSION OF THESIS\\nPR 2.10.1 If there is no unanimity among the recommendations from the examiners of the thesis\\nat the first submission the following procedure shall be adopted.\\nPR 2.10.2 In the first instance, Student and Programme Administration shall consult with the\\nexaminers to see whether an agreed recommendation can be drawn up.\\nPR 2.10.3 If agreement is not achieved, the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate\\nmay at their discretion appoint one or more additional external examiners or may\\ndetermine other action as appropriate. Any additional examiners shall be informed that\\nthe examiners appointed initially have submitted conflicting recommendations but shall\\nnot be told the identity of these examiners nor their specific recommendations.

As well as the assessment of the work itself, all PhD, MPhil and\\nMA/MSc by Research students undergo an oral examination.\\nPR 5.1.2 There shall always be at least one internal examiner and one external examiner. If a\\nstudent has had a connection with the department or university beyond that of being a\\nresearch student, i.e. as a member of staff or a research assistant, then a second\\nexternal examiner is required. If a suitable internal examiner cannot be found or if only\\nthe supervisor would be suitable, then a second external examiner would also be\\nrequired.\\nPR 5.2 EXTERNAL EXAMINERS: ELIGIBILITY AND APPOINTMENT\\nPR 5.2.1 The external examiner shall normally be a senior academic from another institution\\nqualified to assess the thesis within its own field and to compare its quality with work of\\nMPhil/PhD standard at other British universities although where appropriate an\\nexaminer from outside the university sector may be appointed.\\nPR 5.2.2 All external examiner(s) shall:\\n(a) be competent in the area of work being examined;\\n(b) be experienced in research, including having published;\\n(c) be experienced in the examination of research students.\\nPR 5.2.3 Where it is deemed to be appropriate to appoint an examiner from outside the\\nuniversity sector, the person nominated must have an understanding of the examination\\nprocess, and if they have not previously examined a research student, then the internal\\nexaminer must be widely experienced as an examiner.\\nPR 5.2.4 The University shall appoint appropriate external examiners on the nomination of heads\\nof departments and subject to approval by the body or officer with delegated authority\\nfrom Senate on behalf of the Committee of Senate.\\nPR 5.3 INTERNAL EXAMINERS: ELIGIBILITY AND APPOINTMENT\\nPR 5.3.1 Internal examiners shall be members of staff from either the same department or an\\narea cognate to the student’s field of research. Where the internal examiner is not an\\nexpert in the precise field of research they shall be acquainted with the broad area\\nwithin which it falls. In addition, the internal examiner should normally hold a degree at\\nleast equivalent to that for which the student is being examined, and should be\\nexperienced in research. Lancaster University Guidance for the Examination of Research\\nDegrees is available online. The Guidance confirms that the internal examiner must be\\nand be seen to be independent; and thus wherever practicable they should not have\\nVersion 1.1 25\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nplayed any significant role in either the supervision of the student or the assessment of\\nthe student during their studies.\\nPR 5.4 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\\nPR 5.4.1 The student’s supervisor should not normally act as the internal examiner. If the\\nsupervisor has to act as internal examiner, then an additional examiner (internal or\\nexternal) shall be appointed.\\nPR 5.4.2 An external examiner shall not normally have any conflict of interest when appointed.\\nExamples of conflicts of interest to avoid include external examiners who:\\n(a) have had any previous specific contact with the student;\\n(b) have been a former member of Lancaster’s staff or have had a formal\\nconnection with the student’s department within the last five years;\\n(c) have been a student of Lancaster University or one of its collaborative partners\\nwithin the last five years;\\n(d) have examined more than four Lancaster University research students within\\nthe last five years;\\n(e) be a close relative or be otherwise closely connected with any other party to the\\nexamination;\\n(f) have co-authored or held a research grant with a supervisor of the student being\\nexamined within the last five years.\\nWhere a department identifies circumstances which might be perceived to be a conflict\\nof interest, they are encouraged to contact their Quality Assurance and Enhancement\\nManager for further advice.\\nPR 6 POSTHUMOUS AWARDS (PHD AND MPHIL AND MASTERS BY\\nRESEARCH)\\nPR 6.1 A recommendation may be made to the body or officer with delegated authority from\\nSenate for the award of a posthumous degree to PhD, MPhil and Masters by Research\\ncandidates.\\nPR 6.2 If the candidate died after the thesis had been submitted but before the oral\\nexamination had taken place the following procedures should be followed:\\n(a) Examiners must be nominated and the thesis assessed in the usual way.\\n(b) The Examiners are required to report independently on the thesis and submit\\ntheir reports to the University.\\n(c) The supervisor/s and other members of the supervisory team are required to\\nconfirm that the work is the candidate’s own.\\nVersion 1.1 26\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n(d) The Examiners, on the basis of the evidence available and their judgement on\\nthe standard of the thesis and the work represented therein, shall make one of\\nthe following recommendations:\\n(i) that the degree of PhD be awarded;\\n(ii) that the degree of MPhil be awarded (PhD and MPhil candidates);\\n(iii) that the degree of Masters by Research be awarded\\n(iv) that no award be made.\\n(e) No corrections need be made to the thesis and it should be marked as having\\nbeen assessed posthumously.\\n(f) The Examiners' reports and recommendations will then be considered by the\\nbody or officer with delegated authority from Senate, on behalf of the\\nCommittee of the Senate, who shall decide upon the outcome.\\nPR 6.3 If the candidate died after the oral examination but before any required corrections or\\nresubmission could be undertaken the following procedures should be followed:\\n(a) The Examiners, on the basis of the oral examination and their judgement on the\\nstandard of the thesis and the work represented therein, shall make one of the\\nfollowing recommendations:\\n(i) that the degree of PhD be awarded;\\n(ii) that the degree of MPhil be awarded (PhD and MPhil candidates);\\n(iii) that the degree of Masters by Research be awarded;\\n(iv) that no award be made.\\n(b) No corrections need be made to the thesis.\\n(c) The Examiners’ reports and recommendations will then be considered by the\\nbody or officer with delegated authority from Senate, on behalf of the\\nCommittee of the Senate, who shall decide upon the outcome.\\nVersion 1.1 27\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nAPPENDICES TO THE POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH REGULATIONS\\nAPPENDIX 1: DEFINITIONS OF POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH AWARDS\\n1.

A candidate in respect of whom the board has recommended (i) above, shall submit to a\\ndepartmental panel), normally within six calendar months from the date of notification of (i),\\na proposal for a thesis of up to 70,000 words. After consideration of the proposal, the panel\\nmay recommend one of the following:\\n(a) that the candidate’s registration for a PhD be confirmed, or\\n(b) that the candidate be invited to revise and re-submit the proposal with one further\\nopportunity to apply for a transfer of registration to PhD; or\\n(c) that the candidate be invited to complete the requirements for the award of MPhil.\\nNote: in the event that the board recommends (c), the candidate shall be eligible to appeal.\\n12. A candidate who has satisfied the requirements shall be required to submit a thesis of\\nnormally not more than 70,000 words. The thesis shall be examined according to the\\nnormal regulations. To be eligible for the award of the PhD, the thesis shall make an original\\ncontribution to knowledge and contain material of a standard appropriate for scholarly\\npublication.\\nMULTIMODAL RESEARCH DEGREES\\n13. Subject to discussion and approval within departments, a candidate for the degree of PhD or\\nMPhil may submit a multimodal thesis comprised of two components:\\n(a) a written thesis; and\\n(b) a substantial practical work (e.g. a theatrical production, installation, exhibition of\\nwork, recital, lecture-recital, or some other performative or participatory event, a\\nplay, a translation, a design, computer software, creative writing, a model or\\nprototype, a series of conceptual works).\\n14. The practical and written components, which interdependently constitute the “thesis” as\\nsuch, will be evaluated in relation to each other after the written component has been\\nsubmitted.\\n15. The examiners will evaluate the practical and written components according to the extent to\\nwhich they both respond to a single list of specific and explicit research questions which\\nshould be submitted prior to the presentation of the practical component.\\n16. The practical component must negotiate and articulate a response to the research questions\\nthrough an appropriate level of skill in the manipulation of the materials of production or\\nevent. For the degree of PhD, the practical component, which can consist of a minor and a\\nmajor submission, should normally be of an appropriate professional standard.\\n17 If the practical component involves the creation of a performance event/works or exhibition\\nof work:\\n(a) the board of examiners is required to attend the performance, event or exhibition;\\n(b) an audiovisual record of that event/work, or even live performances of that work on\\ntour, will not be acceptable in lieu of a live performance or event at a designated\\nVersion 1.1 37\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nvenue unless the medium of audiovisual recording, the contingencies of touring, or\\nthe absence of locality, are factored into the research topic.\\n18. A permanent record of the practical component should normally be deposited with the\\nwritten thesis in the University Library.\\n19. Just as the examiners can, according to the rules of the University, require the candidate to\\namend or revise a written thesis in part of in whole as a condition of an award, so they can\\nalso require the candidate to amend or revise the practical component in part or in whole,\\nbut only on the condition that they are not satisfied that any shortcomings in the practical\\nsubmission can be compensated or accounted for in the written thesis. In such a case, the\\nexaminers should, wherever possible, set a cost-effective practical assignment that\\naddresses their concerns rather than demand a revision of the original practical work in its\\nentirety.\\n20. The written thesis must be of a quality commensurate with the usual standards set for MPhil\\nor PhD, but need not be of the same length. Departments will advise each candidate on the\\nexact minimum length of the written thesis. For a 50/50 split assessment the written thesis\\nshould not normally exceed 40,000 words for a PhD and 20,000 words for an MPhil (noting\\nthe word length inclusions and exclusions detailed in Appendix 2). In other cases (e.g. 70/30\\nthesis/practical split) the word count will be agreed by the supervisor, the appropriate\\ntransfer panel and the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate. The length of\\nthe written thesis should normally be agreed on a proportionate basis.\\nDOCTOR OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY (DCLINPSY)\\n21. In addition to the normal requirements for admission and award, a candidate shall maintain\\nthroughout the period of study their registration with the British Psychological Society.\\n22. A candidate shall register at the outset for a DClinPsy qualification and undertake taught\\ncourses and clinical placements specified by the department of registration. Such courses\\nshall normally be completed within thirty-six months of first registration.\\n23. Successful completion of each course and placement is both qualificatory and progressional.\\nA candidate who fails to satisfy the requirements of the scheme of assessment within the\\nspecified opportunities for examination and re-examination shall be required to withdraw.\\nStudents may appeal against this decision under the procedures for Academic Appeals.\\n24. A candidate who successfully completes all the required courses and placements shall,\\nnormally by early June of the third year of study, submit for examination a dissertation. The\\ndissertation shall not exceed 56,000 words in length, inclusive of references and appendices.\\nA successful candidate for the degree of DClinPsy shall show convincing evidence of the\\ncapacity to pursue scholarly research or scholarship, the results of which shall be embodied\\nin a dissertation which makes an original contribution to knowledge and contains material of\\na standard appropriate for scholarly publication. External examiners for the thesis will be\\ncompetent in the area of clinical psychology being examined and may be engaged by the\\nVersion 1.1 38\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nUniversity to examine up to four DClinPsy candidates per year over a maximum period of up\\nto four years.6\\nDOCTOR OF MEDICINE (MD)\\n25. Eligibility: the award of MD is at doctoral level, and shall normally be taken after a candidate\\ncan demonstrate suitable clinical experience as an element of the admissions process.\\n26. Level: the Lancaster MD shall be a research degree that contains research conducted at the\\ndoctoral level, both in terms of the publishable quality of research that is expected in the\\nthesis, and when viewed alongside the QAA's FHEQ level descriptors. It shall be comparable\\nin level to the Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy).\\n27. Content: the degree will be awarded for research by thesis or by publication. The thesis\\nshould contain original work of publishable quality, but not necessarily in a publishable\\nformat. An award based on published work (defined as papers produced during registration)\\nwill use the same criteria as the University's existing multi-part thesis format.\\n28. Duration: candidates will demonstrate, as an element of admissions, suitable prior\\nexperience in their chosen area of clinical study so as to be able to provide a basis for\\nresearch equivalent to one-year of doctoral research; thereafter there will be a two-year\\nminimum period of registration, full-time (or equivalent); exceptionally less for MD by\\npublished work.\\n29. Entry requirements: applicants must hold a medical or dental qualification which is\\nrecognised by the General Medical/Dental Council for the United Kingdom, shall have held\\nthis qualification for at least three years, by the date of submission, and shall be employed\\nduring their period of registration in appropriate clinical or scientific work in hospitals or\\ninstitutions associated with the University.\\n30. Admission: The University shall only admit students for whom it is able to provide adequate\\nand appropriate academic supervision. Each application shall be considered by an MD\\nadmissions panel, whose members shall include the potential supervisor(s) and the relevant\\nhead of department.\\n31. Initial registration: Students shall be initially registered for MSc by Research and the\\nregistration shall be transferred to MD on satisfactory completion of the first year, based on\\nevidence of research performance commensurate with doctoral level of study, judged by a\\nwritten report and a viva voce examination.\\n32. Supervision: Each student shall be allocated to a supervisor by the department, who shall\\nnormally be an academic member of staff of the University, and who shall carry out the\\nnormal duties of a supervisor. In addition the faculty shall, where appropriate, arrange for\\neach student to have access to clinical supervision, normally through the clinical institution\\nwhere the student is undertaking their research.\\n6 The alternative arrangements for DClinPsy external examiner appointments shall be reviewed prior to the\\n2026/27 academic year to confirm continued suitability and effectiveness.\\nVersion 1.1 39\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n33. Research skills: Each student shall be provided with opportunities to develop generic\\nresearch skills including taking appropriate postgraduate taught modules, which shall be\\ndefined by the principal supervisor in consultation with the student. This taught element\\nshall not form part of the formal assessment for the award of MD.\\nMULTI-PART THESES COMPRISED OF PAPERS AND ARTICLES\\n34. The candidate’s department of registration shall maintain and provide guidelines on the\\nmulti-part format(s) judged appropriate to the discipline, for the information of students,\\nsupervisors and examiners. A department must obtain approval of its guidelines by the\\nfaculty committee responsible for postgraduate provision.\\nNotes:\\n(a) a candidate is encouraged to seek advice within their department of registration\\nthat the multi-part format is more appropriate for the research project and that they\\ncan take full advantage of the format;\\n(b) supervising departments are encouraged to seek, where practicable, the advice of\\nthe External Examiner(s) with respect to the format proposed; and\\n(c) the guidelines shall form the basis of agreement between the student, supervisor\\nand head of department (or their nominee) on the multi-part format to be employed\\nin the submission.\\n35. The thesis shall include original, researched materials, of which a significant proportion shall\\nbe derived from original research undertaken after the date of first registration.\\nNotes: it is anticipated that at the point of thesis submission materials be:\\n(a) already published; and/or\\n(b) accepted for publication; and/or\\n(c) submitted for publication in externally refereed contexts such as journals,\\nconference proceedings and on-line sites, and may include materials which are\\nsolely and/or partly authored by the candidate.\\nIt is not a requirement that all materials be published or accepted or submitted for\\npublication, prior to the submission of the thesis for examination.\\n36. Examiners shall satisfy themselves that the thesis as a whole meets the criteria for award of\\nthe degree, as outlined above.\\nNotes: examiners:\\n(a) may wish to pay particular attention to satisfying themselves that of any multi-\\nauthored materials included, a significant proportion is the work principally of the\\ncandidate; and\\n(b) are reminded of the freedom to specify additional tests as part of the examination.\\nVersion 1.1 40\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nEUROPEAN DOCTORATE\\n37. The European Doctorate is a qualification that was created by the Confederation of EU\\nRectors’ Conference (now the European University Association) and provides the\\nopportunity to study for a qualification which meets the criteria which are commonly\\nunderstood to be met in a doctorate, using examination procedures that are widely\\nrecognised across Europe, involving an ability to work in more than one language, and\\nentailing periods of time spent working in institution across more than one EU member\\nstate.\\n38. The characteristics of the European Doctorate are those of the traditional Lancaster PhD\\nwith the following amendments.\\n(a) The thesis should be reviewed by at least two academics from different higher\\neducation institutions in different EU countries, excluding the UK. At least one\\nmember of the exam board should come from an EU country other than the UK. In\\nthe Lancaster context, this requirement would most easily be implemented by\\nhaving two External Examiners at the board from EU countries other than the UK.\\n(b) Part of the defence must take place in one of the official languages of the EU other\\nthan English.\\n(c) The thesis must have been prepared partly as a result of a research period of at least\\none term spent at an institution in an EU country other than the UK.\\n39. The European doctorate is available in any of the areas in which the PhD is currently\\navailable at Lancaster, and is offered under the title of European Doctorate in XXXX, with\\npostnominal letters of PhD.\\nDSc and DLitt\\n40. To be eligible for the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc) or of Doctor of Letters (DLitt),\\ncandidates shall be either graduates of the University, or members of staff of the University,\\nwhose record of published work and research shows conspicuous ability and originality and\\nconstitutes a distinguished and sustained achievement.\\n41. Any person who wishes to be considered for the award of the degree of DSc/DLitt shall\\nsubmit a formal written letter of application to the Head of Student and Programme\\nAdministration, stating in outline on what basis the award is sought and what evidence in\\nsupport of the application is available. Such letters of application may be submitted at any\\ntime.\\n42. As soon as possible after the letter of application has been submitted, the Head of Student\\nand Programme Administration, acting on the advice of the relevant faculty dean, shall\\nrecommend to the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate an appropriate\\nsenior academic member of staff of the University or equivalent with appropriate specialist\\nknowledge of and expertise in the field, to consider the information supplied.\\n43. The member of staff appointed shall consider whether a prima facie case for formal\\nexamination exists and shall recommend either:\\nVersion 1.1 41\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n(a) that the application proceed, in which case the procedure to be followed is that\\nspecified below; or\\n(b) that the application is not suitable for examination, in which case the procedure to\\nbe followed is that specified below.\\n44. Where a recommendation for formal examination to proceed is made, the member of staff\\nshall recommend persons who might be appointed as examiners. The body or officer with\\ndelegated authority from Senate, acting on behalf of the Committee of Senate on the advice\\nof the Head of Student and Programme Administration, shall approve the appointment of\\nnot fewer that two independent External Examiners, with expertise in the field, one of\\nwhom shall be the lead examiner. The officer with delegated authority from Senate, or their\\nnominee, shall act as the internal examiner.\\n45. The Head of Student and Programme Administration shall inform the applicant of the\\nappointment of examiners, of what additional material in support of the application is\\nrequired, and of the fee to be paid prior to the examination.\\n46. Where a recommendation is made that the application is not suitable for examination, the\\nHead of Student and Programme Administration shall advise the candidate of this\\nrecommendation.\\n47. In such cases the candidate may:\\n(a) withdraw the application, whereupon no fee shall be payable;\\n(b) elect to proceed with the examination, and be liable for payment of the full fee,\\nsubject to confirmation by the Head of Student and Programme Administration that\\nappropriate External Examiners are available and willing to act. In the absence of\\nsuch confirmation the application will lapse.\\nPHD BY PUBLISHED WORK\\nAward criteria\\n48. To be awarded a PhD by Published Work a candidate must show that their work makes a\\nsignificant contribution to knowledge in a particular field. The publications must also\\nprovide evidence of the capacity of the candidate to pursue further research, representing a\\ncoherent contribution to research in a given field and demonstrating a depth of scholarship\\nand originality comparable with that required in a PhD thesis. The material submitted shall\\nbe sufficiently extensive as to provide convincing evidence that the research constitutes a\\nsubstantial contribution to knowledge or scholarship.\\nAdmissions criteria\\n49. Candidates for the degree of PhD by submission of published work must be:\\n(a) members or past members of staff at Lancaster University or at one of Lancaster\\nUniversity's associated institutions (University of Cumbria, Blackburn College, and\\nBlackpool and The Fylde College); or\\nVersion 1.1 42\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n(b) alumni of Lancaster University or of one of Lancaster University's associated\\ninstitutions.\\n50. In order to be eligible for consideration, alumni must be graduates of at least five years'\\nstanding and have already obtained a Master’s degree or show evidence of having received\\nresearch training or equivalent experience. In exceptional circumstances, other candidates\\nmay also be considered.\\nApplications and registration\\n51. Applications may be made at any time. A letter of application should be accompanied by:\\n(a) a list of the publications to be submitted: these may include refereed articles,\\nauthored chapters, authored books, and edited works. They may not include course\\nreaders, internally published material or unpublished seminar/conference papers;\\nand\\n(b) a supporting paper: this should summarise each publication submitted, outline their\\ninterrelationship, give a critical review of the current state of knowledge and\\nresearch in the applicant's field and indicate how their work has contributed to the\\nfield. It should also comment on the standing of any journals and the reception of\\nthe publications as indicated by citations and reviews.\\n52. The candidate's application shall first be considered by either a Faculty’s Associate Dean for\\nResearch or Postgraduate Studies (according to which officer has responsibility for PhD\\nstudy), in consultation with the Head of the appropriate department. If the application is\\naccepted, the applicant will then be registered to submit for the degree of PhD by Published\\nWork, and an internal adviser will be appointed by the Head of Department to assist the\\ncandidate. A minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months are\\nallowed before submission.\\nExamination\\n53. Candidate shall submit for examination:\\n(a) three copies, in published form, of each item forming part of the work on which the\\napplication for the degree by published work is based. Permission to include work in\\nmanuscript, but which has been accepted for publication, may be granted;\\n(b) four copies of the supporting paper, modified, if necessary after consultation with\\nthe advisor;\\n(c) a statement as to what part if any of the material has been submitted for a degree\\nor other qualification in this or any other University or other institution, explaining\\nthe reason for its inclusion and, if joint work is submitted, what part of it is the\\ncandidate's contribution.\\n54. A panel of examiners consisting of one internal and two External Examiners shall be\\nappointed by the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate on behalf of the\\nCommittee of the Senate on the nomination of the department(s) concerned. The internal\\nexaminer will not normally have been appointed as adviser to the candidate. An oral\\nexamination will normally be held for the degree, but this requirement may be waived with\\nVersion 1.1 43\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nthe approval of the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate provided that all\\nthe examiners are in agreement.\\n55. The examiners shall make one of the following recommendations:\\n(a) that the degree of PhD by published work be awarded;\\n(b) that the degree be awarded subject to specified revisions of the supporting paper;\\nor\\n(c) that the degree be not awarded.\\n56. The examiners may not recommend the award of a lower degree.\\n57. A candidate whose work has been found unacceptable for the award of the degree may be\\npermitted to resubmit only after completing re-registration; normally, this would be no\\nearlier than two years after the original submission.\\n58. Examiners' reports and recommendations are considered by the body or officer with\\ndelegated authority from Senate on behalf of the Committee of the Senate, and a decision\\ngiven to the candidate within one month of the oral examination.\\nVersion 1.1 44\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nAPPENDIX 4: FRAMEWORK FOR THE RESEARCH DEGREE VIVA\\nThe guidance set out below, and approved by the Senate, is designed to best protect the interests of\\nall participants in the process, for any research degree examination leading to a Lancaster award\\n(even when a viva voce is held away from Lancaster).\\n1. Definition of the viva voce\\n1.1 A viva voce is an oral examination of a research degree thesis, and of the student who wrote\\nit, which is normally conducted in person, at Lancaster, by an internal and an external\\nexaminer.\\n1.2 The first stage of the examination is the review of the student’s thesis. Student and\\nProgramme Administration is responsible for sending a copy of the thesis to each examiner.\\nThe examiners independently read the thesis and write a Pre-Viva Voce report on it, with\\ncomments about its contribution to the field, its strengths and weaknesses, and possibly a\\nrange of points which they will raise at the viva voce.\\n2. Status of the viva voce\\n2.1 The viva voce is a compulsory part of all research degree examinations unless otherwise\\nspecified in the regulations however excellent or poor the thesis may be. The student\\nalways has the right to defend their work to the examiners.\\n2.2 It is not possible under current regulations for a student to fail a research degree outright\\nwithout undertaking a viva voce.\\n3. Role of each participant in the viva voce\\n3.1 The external examiner(s): the role of the external examiner(s) (someone not connected with\\nthe University) is to assess the quality of the submission and help to uphold the quality of\\nthe degree in the UK.\\n3.2 In certain circumstances, there may be a third examiner, external to the University, involved\\nto ensure impartiality. This would happen if:\\n(a) the student is a member of staff, or holds a temporary teaching or research contract\\nat the University;\\n(b) the student is being examined for a Ph.D. by Published Work;\\n(c) the student’s supervisor is acting also as the internal examiner.\\n3.3 The internal examiner(s): the role of the internal examiner(s) is to assess the quality of the\\nsubmission and help to uphold the quality of a Lancaster award. The role is similar to that of\\nthe external examiner(s), and it has equal status and standing. It is not the role of the\\ninternal examiner to protect the student, to be the student’s friend, and/or to defend the\\nsupervisor, department or institution against criticism from the external examiner(s), nor to\\nact as chair in the viva voce (unless the department decides not to have an independent\\nchair: see clause 6.1). The internal examiner must be and be seen to be independent; and\\nthus wherever practicable they should not have played any significant role in either the\\nVersion 1.1 45\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nsupervision of the student or the assessment of the student during their studies (e.g. annual\\nprogress review, confirmation panel).\\n3.4 The independent chair: the role of the independent chair is to be an observer and manager\\nof the meeting, and to ensure that procedures are followed properly. The chair does not\\nneed to be a subject specialist, does not need to have read the thesis, and is not directly\\ninvolved in examining it. If a department decides not to have an independent chair (see\\nclause 6.1), it must arrange for an audio record of the viva voce to be made and retained\\n(see clause 7). If there is no independent chair, the internal examiner will normally be\\nexpected to chair the viva voce. There should always be an independent chair where the\\ninternal and/or external examiners are inexperienced (usually defined as having participated\\nin less than two vivas at the appropriate level).\\n3.5 The student: the role of the student is to discuss, explain and defend their work as\\nrepresented in the thesis being examined, to be open to critical appraisal by the examiners,\\nand to be prepared and willing to engage in a dialogue with the examiners about the\\nsubstance and field of enquiry of the thesis.\\n3.6 The supervisor(s): whether the supervisor is present throughout the viva voce (see clause\\n5.1 (a)), or attends at the end when the examiner’s report to the student their decision\\nabout the outcome of the examination, their role is to be a silent witness to the proceedings,\\nand through that to be able to provide feedback to and advise the student after the viva\\nvoce is completed.\\n4. Student preparation for the viva voce\\n4.1 All students should be allowed and encouraged to acquire relevant experience in defending\\nthe thesis, in advance of the viva voce, including:\\n(a) by robust interrogation of their work and progress during each annual appraisal and\\nat the confirmation panel;\\n(b) by being given special training for the viva voce (including a mock viva voce). This is\\nprobably best done by their faculty (e.g. through the faculty training programmes).\\n4.2 It would be inappropriate for the chair and/or internal examiner(s) to be directly involved in\\nthe student’s training for the viva voce.\\n5. Membership of viva voce panel\\n5.1 Supervisor\\n(a) The student’s supervisor(s) may attend the viva voce with the approval of the\\nexaminers and the student.\\n(b) If not present throughout the viva voce, the supervisor(s) may be invited to attend\\nthe final stage of the viva voce when the examiners report their decision to the\\nstudent, unless the student advises the chair, before the viva voce, that they would\\nprefer the supervisor not to attend.\\n(c) If present, the supervisor(s) must remain silent and impassive, unless specifically\\ninvited to comment on specific points, by the examiners, through the chair.\\nVersion 1.1 46\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n5.2 Independent chair\\n(a) There should normally be an independent chair present throughout the viva voce\\n(see clause 6.1). The independent chair should normally be a member of academic\\nstaff (or an emeritus member) at the level of Senior Lecturer or above, OR who has\\nexperience of conducting at least three research degree vivas as an examiner and\\nhas supervised at least one student to completion. The chair should not be an\\nexaminer or supervisor of the student being examined.\\n(b) The independent chair should be selected by the relevant head of department or\\ntheir nominee.\\n(c) The chair must be familiar with this guidance, and with the Regulations for Higher\\nDegrees of the University.\\n(d) No member of staff should normally be expected to serve as independent chair on\\nmore than one viva voce per term (three per year).\\n6. Chair and/or audio record\\n6.1 For examinations (whether in-person or online), departments have discretion to decide, on a\\ncase-by-case basis, whether to have an independent chair (see clause 5.2) and/or to keep an\\naudio record (see clause 7.1) of the viva voce proceedings. They must adopt at least one of\\nthe two.\\n6.2 An independent chair and an audio record do not serve the same purpose, so departments\\nneed to give careful thought about which one(s) they will adopt in each case.\\n6.3 The decisions about the independent chair and the audio record must be notified to Student\\nand Programme Administration at the time of appointment of the internal and external\\nexaminers.\\n7. Record keeping\\n7.1 Departments have discretion not to make an audio record of a particular viva voce, provided\\nthey appoint an independent chair (see clause 6.1).\\n7.2 If the department decides that it is appropriate to record a viva voce on audio tape or\\nminidisk, the person taking the chair at the viva voce should ensure that the audio record is\\nmade and lodged with Student and Programme Administration.\\n7.3 Nothing will be done with the recording (no one will listen to it) unless it is to be used as\\nevidence in the event of an appeal/complaint.\\n7.4 The recording should normally be kept for no longer than twelve months after the viva voce,\\nunless the student has made an appeal/complaint against the decision of the examiners (in\\nwhich case the recording should be kept until the end of the appeal/complaint process).\\nVersion 1.1 47\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n8. Timing and arrangements\\n8.1 The maximum period of time between submission of thesis by student and the date of the\\nviva voce examination should normally be three months.\\n8.2 The postgraduate director in the student’s department is responsible for making\\narrangements for the viva voce (including day, time, location and name of the independent\\nchair if there is one), and for communicating this information to the examiners, the student,\\nthe chair and the supervisor(s).\\n8.3 Appropriate arrangements should be made available for disabled students, on the same\\nbasis as for other forms of University assessments, in order to provide an equal opportunity\\nto defend the thesis.\\n8.4 The examiners, chair and student should be given as much notice as possible about the day\\nand time of the viva voce, and this should normally be not less than two weeks prior to the\\nappointed date.\\n8.5 The chair is responsible for making sure that seating arrangements in the viva voce room are\\nappropriate for dialogue between the participants.\\n8.6 Video-conferencing of a viva voce examination, with either the candidate or an examiner at\\na remote location, is permissible as long as the student is not disadvantaged by its use, and\\nas long as all parties consent to it. The University retains the right to refuse a request to use\\nvideo-conferencing; such a refusal will not constitute grounds for appeal. Guidance for the\\nconduct of such a viva voce examination is in Appendix 5.\\n8.7 The internal examiner should collate written guidance from all the examiners on required\\nchanges to the thesis to be undertaken within a reasonable period of time after the viva\\nvoce. For minor corrections the information should normally be collated within two weeks;\\nfor major corrections or revisions to the thesis within one month.\\n8.8 The internal examiner should forward the written guidance from the examiners to the\\nstudent, and send a copy to Student and Programme Administration, without delay.\\n8.9 The period for corrections or revisions to the thesis commences on the day written\\nnotification of the decision of the examiners is sent to the student by Student and\\nProgramme Administration.\\n9. Examiners’ written report\\n9.1 Examiners are required to provide written reports on the thesis before the viva voce\\nexamination, to establish that they have read the thesis before the viva voce, and to record\\ntheir initial judgements formed on the basis of reading the thesis.\\n9.2 Examiners are required to write separate such reports independently of each other, and\\nsend them to Student and Programme Administration, before they exchange views and\\ncompare notes with the other examiners.\\n9.3 Examiners should be given the opportunity (but not be required) in such reports to give a\\nprovisional decision about the outcome of the examination.\\nVersion 1.1 48\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n9.4 The reports should only be seen before the viva voce by administrative staff who have no\\nvested interest in the outcome of the examination.\\n9.5 Under Data Protection legislation, the student has no right of access to the reports before\\nthe examination process is complete.\\n10. The purpose of the viva voce examination\\n10.1 The viva voce is an opportunity for the student to defend the thesis.\\n10.2 It is not a purpose of the viva voce to test the student’s command of spoken English in what\\nis often a stressful situation. This is particularly important for students whose first language\\nis not English, and for some disabled students.\\n10.3 The viva voce should normally include the assessment of the student’s ability to:\\n(a) locate their research in the broader context;\\n(b) display detailed knowledge of the thesis;\\n(c) authenticate the work (i.e. to prove that it is the student’s own work).\\n10.4 Criterion (a) should be explicitly commented on in the examiners' reports.\\n10.5 Criteria (a) to (c) should be explicitly evaluated during the viva voce.\\n10.6 It is appropriate in the viva voce to ask questions about the originality of the thesis, and\\nabout the contribution the thesis makes to knowledge.\\n10.7 The student should also be able to defend the methodology and conclusions of the thesis,\\nand display awareness of the limitations of the thesis, in the viva voce.\\n10.8 For the viva voce to be regarded as successful, the student should satisfy the examiners that\\nthey are worthy of the research degree, which ultimately is a matter of academic judgement\\nby the examiners.\\n11. Conduct of the viva voce\\n11.1 Existing University Regulations cover procedures for dealing with disagreements between\\nexaminers.\\n11.2 Examiners should not normally be able to fail or refer a thesis on grounds that are not\\nconsidered with the student in the viva voce. The decision should be based on what is\\ndiscussed in the viva voce.\\n11.3 A recording (see clause 7) is helpful in reconstructing what was discussed in the viva voce,\\nand how it was discussed.\\n11.4 The viva voce should give the student an opportunity to defend anything the examiners\\nregard as problematic. It will normally be expected to touch upon the issues that the\\nexaminers regard as important in reaching their decision about the award of the degree in\\nquestion.\\nVersion 1.1 49\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n11.5 The student should be told by the chair at the beginning of the viva voce, that no\\ninformation about outcomes will be provided until the end of the viva voce examination,\\nand that no conclusions should be drawn from this. This is because to indicate or hint at\\noutcomes could:\\n(a) partly negate the value of the viva in the assessment process;\\n(b) compromise the ability of the examiners to change their mind during the course of\\nthe viva voce;\\n(c) have a significant impact on how the student feels and responds to questioning\\nduring the viva voce.\\n11.6 A typical viva voce should normally last for not less than one hour and not more than four\\nhours, although it is recognised that practice varies between disciplines.\\n11.7 Questions during the viva voce should be fair and appropriate. Fair play should be\\nmaintained, and proper procedures should be followed.\\n11.8 If the chair and examiners anticipate that a viva voce is likely to last more than about two\\nhours, the chair should give an opportunity for a break after two hours, provided that to do\\nso does not disadvantage the student.\\n11.9 The chair shall have final decision on when the viva voce should finish, taking into account\\nthe views of the examiners, and the need to uphold fair play and to give the student an\\nopportunity to defend their work.\\n12. Student role in the viva voce\\n12.1 Examiners are expected to be open-minded in their probing of the student's work, and to\\napproach the task in a spirit of academic integrity.\\n12.2 The chair should ensure that the student is given the opportunity to present a brief verbal\\nsummary of their work (15 minutes maximum), towards the start of the viva voce, if they\\nwish to do so.\\n12.3 The chair should ensure that the student is given an appropriate right of reply to points\\nraised by the examiners, during and at the end of the viva voce.\\n12.4 If the student feels during the course of the viva voce that the questions are not fair or\\nappropriate, that they are being denied the right of reply, or that proper procedures are not\\nbeing followed, they should be able to call for a break, and talk privately with the chair.\\n12.5 If the chair grants such a time out during the viva voce, the conversation between student\\nand chair should not be overheard by the examiners, but it should be recorded on the audio\\ntape or mini-disk if the viva voce is recorded.\\n13. Outcome of the viva voce\\n13.1 Towards the end of the viva voce, the student (and supervisor(s) if present) should be asked\\nto leave the room while the examiners decide what outcome they think appropriate.\\nVersion 1.1 50\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n13.2 The chair should remain present throughout the viva voce.\\n13.3 When the examiners have reached their decision, the student (normally accompanied by the\\nsupervisor(s)) should then be invited back into the room, to be told (normally by the external\\nexaminer) what the examiners will be recommending to the University.\\n13.4 The outcome given at the end of the viva voce is a recommendation, subject to approval by\\nthe body or officer with delegated authority from the Committee of Senate.\\n14. Post-Viva Voce Reports\\n14.1 All examiners are required to submit a further written report after the viva voce, which\\nincludes their judgement of the quality of the thesis and the student’s performance in the\\nviva voce, and contains their recommendation about the award of the degree:\\n(a) examiners can submit a joint report if they agree on the outcome, and if producing a\\njoint report is practical under the circumstances;\\n(b) examiners must submit separate reports if they disagree on the outcome.\\n14.2 Under Data Protection legislation, students have a right of access to their post-viva voce\\nreport after Senate approval of the examiners’ recommendation is confirmed and the\\nexamination (including any revisions) has been completed.\\n14.3 Any examiner may indicate that part (to be highlighted explicitly) or all of their report should\\nbe disclosed to the student before the examiners’ recommendations are approved by the\\nSenate, if the examiner believes this would help the student to make appropriate\\ncorrections or revisions.\\n14.4 The internal examiner is responsible for making sure that the student is made fully aware of\\nthe examiners’ expectations in respect of which corrections or revisions are felt necessary\\n(see 8.6).\\n15. Second Viva Voce\\n15.1 The examiners can require a student to attend a second viva voce as part of the examination\\nof a revised and resubmitted thesis or where major corrections are required, but not for\\nminor corrections.\\n16. Student’s right of appeal\\n16.1 A student has no right of appeal against the academic judgement of the examiners. A\\nstudent may appeal, however, against the outcome of the examination under the\\nprocedures for Academic Appeals as defined in the chapter on Academic Appeals.\\n16.2 All students of the University have the right to make a complaint under the Student Charter.\\n17. Publication of guidelines\\n17.1 These guidelines and criteria will be published on the University web site, and will be:\\n(a) given to each research degree student when submitting the thesis;\\nVersion 1.1 51\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n(b) given to the examiners on appointment, to the chair on designation, and to the\\nsupervisor on submission of the thesis.\\nVersion 1.1 52\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nAPPENDIX 5: ONLINE VIVA VOCE EXAMINATIONS\\nThis appendix should be read in conjunction with the guidance provided in\\n‘Staff information and processes for an online viva’. All parties should\\nconsult the guidance at least one week prior to the examination.\\n1. Online vivas may be overseen by an independent chair, or recorded, or both overseen by an\\nindependent chair and recorded. The criteria for the appointment of the chair are set out in\\nthe Framework for the Research Degree Viva (Appendix 4), as is guidance about recording the\\nviva.\\n2. The chair should ensure that:\\na) all parties involved in the examination are informed in good time of the details of the\\nexamination;\\nb) all parties have access to, and are familiar with the necessary technology and\\ncontingency plans;\\nc) the correct process is followed for the viva;\\nd) the wellbeing of the candidate is attended to over the course of the viva; and\\ne) the recording of the examination is secured and lodged in accordance with the guidance.\\nShould the candidate become distressed, the chair has the authority to briefly adjourn the\\nexamination and to speak to the candidate privately.\\n3. Where the department decides to record an online viva (following the clauses in Appendix 4\\n6.1-3 above), the candidate’s assent to this will be presumed unless they lodge a formal\\nobjection with the department in advance of the examination. The examiners’ consent to\\nthe recording of the viva must be obtained and confirmed on the Appointment of Research\\nExaminers Form. The deliberations of the examiners must not be recorded. The recording\\nremains the property of the University and no other recording is permitted to take place.\\n4. Only the University’s supported, licensed and approved software for online meetings should\\nbe used for the purposes of conducting online vivas. Alternative software should only be\\nused where necessary, and as agreed in the contingency plan.\\n5. Any time differences between the locations must be taken into account to ensure that the\\ncandidate is not disadvantaged by an examination taking place at a time that might\\nreasonably be considered to be inappropriate.\\nVersion 1.1 53\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\n6. Care must be taken to ensure that the technology used is as reliable as possible. To this end,\\nthe equipment and software should be tested at least one week prior to the examination\\nusing the same computers, systems, and locations (i.e. rooms) that will be used during the\\nexamination. Contingency plans are essential in the event of technology failure.\\n7. The candidate’s identity must be confirmed at the beginning of the examination (e.g. by the\\nsupervisor or by a member of professional services staff). Any materials brought into the\\nexamination by the candidate should be identified at the outset, prior to the\\ncommencement of the examination.\\n8. During the examination the examiners should normally be able to view the candidate,\\nalthough it is accepted that for certain disciplines the candidate may need to demonstrate\\nmaterial on screen to the panel. Maintaining continuity of contact, however, is important\\nand expected throughout the viva (excluding agreed breaks).\\n9. The University will not normally permit any person to be present with the candidate other\\nthan technical staff involved in the use of online communication technology or where\\nappropriate support arrangements have been previously agreed with disabled students.\\n10. Each examiner should sign (electronically) the ‘Independent Report’ and the ‘Joint Report’\\nand forward them to Student and Programme Administration as soon as possible after the\\nexamination.\\n11. Examiners should comment on the conduct of the online examination using the standard\\n‘Joint Report’ form and refer explicitly to the fact that it took place under COVID-19\\ntemporary regulations.\\n12. Having agreed to an online examination, the candidate will not be permitted to use this as\\ngrounds for appeal, unless the circumstances of technical failure or other unforeseen\\neventualities beyond the control of the panel were deemed to have adversely affected the\\ncandidate’s performance and these were identified by the examiners in their joint report.\\nVersion 1.1 54\\nMARP 2025-26\\nPostgraduate Research Regulations\\nAPPENDIX 6: DETAIL OF IN-YEAR CHANGE MADE TO CHAPTER\\nVersion Date of change Detail of change & section(s) altered Approval of change\\n1.1 21/11/2025 Amends to Appendix 5, to bring into line with N/a – Administrative\\nreturn of optionality in having independent chair\\nand/or recording for online viva voce\\nexaminations.\\nVersion 1.1 55\""

      "Answer: The vacation policy typically allows students to take breaks from their studies during designated periods, but specific details may vary between programs and departments. Generally, postgraduate research students are encouraged to discuss any planned vacations with their supervisor to ensure that it does not interfere with their research progress. Students should also consider the academic calendar when planning their vacations to align with university-recommended breaks.\n",
