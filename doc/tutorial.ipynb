      "\n",
      "1. **Plagiarism Detection Software**: Universities often use software tools such as Turnitin, iThenticate, or Grammarly to scan submissions for similarities with existing published works, online content, and other students' theses. These tools highlight matches and provide a similarity report.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Manual Review by Examiners**: Examining committees or supervisors may read the theses carefully to identify any instances of plagiarism. They look for inconsistencies in writing style, sudden shifts in quality, or sections that do not align with the student's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Check for Citations and References**: Reviewers assess whether all sources are properly cited and whether the student is correctly attributing ideas and content that are not their own. A lack of citations or incorrect citation practices can indicate potential plagiarism.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Historical Analysis of Student’s Work**: Examiners may compare the thesis with the student's previous submissions to identify any significant overlap or repeated ideas that weren't appropriately acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Viva Voce Examination**: During an oral defense of the thesis (viva), examiners may ask questions about the research and the thesis content. A student's inability to discuss certain sections or unfamiliarity with cited materials may raise concerns about authorship and originality.\n",

Proofreaders must not actively edit or create\\ncontent in a student’s draft work, and must not make any intervention that would\\nsubstantially change the content of a piece of work. It is the student’s responsibility to\\nensure that the work of a proofreader does not also entail instances of academic\\nmalpractice. Further guidelines and the University policy on proofreading are available\\non the web. If students have any questions about the proper application of\\nproofreading, they should contact their academic tutor, module leader, supervisor or a\\nlearning developer in the first instance.\\nAM 2.9 ACADEMIC MALPRACTICE & ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DETECTION SOFTWARE\\nAM 2.9.1 Unless express permission is re']\n",

      "    \"answer\": \"Plagiarism in theses is typically detected through a combination of the following methods:\\n\\n1. **Plagiarism Detection Software**: Universities often use software tools such as Turnitin, iThenticate, or Grammarly to scan submissions for similarities with existing published works, online content, and other students' theses. These tools highlight matches and provide a similarity report.\\n\\n2. **Manual Review by Examiners**: Examining committees or supervisors may read the theses carefully to identify any instances of plagiarism. They look for inconsistencies in writing style, sudden shifts in quality, or sections that do not align with the student's voice.\\n\\n3. **Check for Citations and References**: Reviewers assess whether all sources are properly cited and whether the student is correctly attributing ideas and content that are not their own. A lack of citations or incorrect citation practices can indicate potential plagiarism.\\n\\n4. **Historical Analysis of Student’s Work**: Examiners may compare the thesis with the student's previous submissions to identify any significant overlap or repeated ideas that weren't appropriately acknowledged.\\n\\n5. **Viva Voce Examination**: During an oral defense of the thesis (viva), examiners may ask questions about the research and the thesis content. A student's inability to discuss certain sections or unfamiliarity with cited materials may raise concerns about authorship and originality.\\n\\nIf any signs of academic malpractice, including plagiarism, are detected during these processes, it can lead to further investigation and potential consequences as per the University’s academic integrity regulations.\"\n",
