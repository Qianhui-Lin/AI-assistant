PR 1.2 The University categorises the Master of Research (MRes) as a postgraduate research
degree award. Such programmes are, however, governed by the regulations for
postgraduate taught programmes for the purposes of assessment and classification, and
as such the MRes is included within the Postgraduate Taught Assessment Regulations.
PR 2 PHD REGULATIONS
[Unless otherwise specified in Appendix 3: Regulations for Specific Doctoral Awards or Programmes,
the following regulations for the award of PhD also apply to other doctoral awards.]
PR 2.1 CRITERIA FOR THE AWARD

interpretation of knowledge which extends the forefront of their discipline
through original research;
(e) a detailed understanding of, and ability to use, applicable techniques for
research and advanced inquiry in their field;
(f) that they can make informed judgements on complex issues in their field, often
in the absence of complete data;
(g) that the research is of publishable quality and is of a standard which satisfies
peer review;
(h) that they are competent as an independent researcher in their discipline and
capable of continuing to undertake research at an advanced level, contributing
substantially to the development of new techniques, ideas or approaches;
(i) an understanding of the place of the research in the wider context;

PR 2.2 REGISTRATION PERIOD
PR 2.2.1 For full-time students the minimum period of registration for the degree shall normally
be thirty-six calendar months from the date of commencement of studies to the date of
Version 1.1 4
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
submission of the thesis. The maximum period of registration shall be forty-eight
months. Full-time students may, with the approval of the body or officer with delegated
authority from Senate, be permitted to register for a shorter period, as proposed by the
admitting department. A shorter period of registration, which may in no case be for a
period of less than twelve months, may be justified by recognising the applicant’s
attainment in original research prior to application and not otherwise accredited for a
degree already awarded. Normally an extension beyond the maximum period of
registration will not be permitted, but can be at the discretion of the body or officer with
delegated authority from Senate.
PR 2.2.2 For part-time students the minimum period of registration for the degree shall normally
be forty-eight calendar months from the date of commencement of studies to the date
of submission of the thesis. The maximum period of registration shall be eighty-four
months. Part-time students may, with the approval of the body or officer with
delegated authority from Senate, be permitted to register for a shorter period, as
proposed by the admitting department. A shorter period of registration, which may in
no case be for a period of less than twenty-four months, may be justified by recognising
the applicant’s attainment in original research prior to application and not otherwise
accredited for a degree already awarded. Normally an extension beyond the maximum
period of registration will not be permitted, but can be at the discretion of the body or
officer with delegated authority from Senate.
PR 2.2.3 Where a student changes mode of study, the duration of their remaining study will be
calculated using a full-time study to part-time study ratio of 1:1.75, rounding up to the
nearest month.
PR 2.2.4 In the event of an extension request being refused, PGR students have the right to
appeal to the relevant faculty Associate Dean with a final appeal to the University
Academic Dean.
PR 2.3 SCHEDULE OF WORK
PR 2.3.1 Upon registration each student will be assigned a minimum of one main supervisor, who
will normally be part of a supervisory team.
PR 2.3.2 The nature of the student’s research programme should be on a scale which should be
completed during three years, or at most four years, of full-time study or equivalent.
PR 2.3.3 The supervisor(s) and student should agree a realistic completion timetable which will
enable the student to produce a thesis of the required standard within the stipulated
time-scale. The supervisor(s) and student will agree milestones throughout this
schedule against which progress will be monitored. Progress is monitored through
appraisal meetings between the supervisor(s) and student. Further details of the
appraisal process may be found in the University’s Code of Practice on Postgraduate
Research Programmes.
Version 1.1 5
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
PR 2.4 PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS
Year 1 (year 2 part-time)
PR 2.4.1 Within the first six months all research students must fulfil the following, or an
equivalent, process:
(a) attend an approved induction programme;
(b) carry out an approved development needs analysis (DNA) or equivalent in
consultation with their supervisors, and keep a record of agreed follow-up to the
DNA;
(c) take the appropriate research training activities, informed by the DNA as guided
by their supervisors;
(d) complete a research proposal or plan of work which the supervisors approve as
appropriate and viable;
(e) complete the mandatory Research Integrity and Ethical Research training;
(f) agree any additional training that may be required;
(g) agree a projected completion timetable with their supervisors; and
(h) any additional requirements to meet the particular needs of the individual
awards.
PR 2.4.2 Any research student who does not demonstrate satisfactory progress during the first six
months full-time should be: carefully monitored and supported, informed about any
reasons for concern, set objectives, and their progress reviewed before the twelve-
month deadline. If their progress is still not satisfactory they will be referred to the
Standing Academic Committee by the academic department with a recommendation for
exclusion from the programme. Students who have been excluded for failing to make
satisfactory progress may appeal against the exclusion under the Academic Appeals
procedures as defined in the chapter on Academic Appeals.
PR 2.4.3 Confirmation of PhD status, where appropriate, may be conferred at this stage in
accordance with the procedures (see PR 2.5 below).
PR 2.4.4 It is the responsibility of the student and supervisor to identify whether ethical approval
is required for any part of the research.1 If it is, then no research requiring ethical
approval can be conducted before ethical approval has been granted by the Faculty
Research Ethics Committee.
1 Students and Supervisors should consult the guidance on Research Ethics, or consult their Faculty Ethics
Committee to determine whether ethical approval is required.
Version 1.1 6
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
Years 2 to 4 (or part-time equivalents)
PR 2.4.5 Continued registration of a student in years 2, 3 and 4 on the research component of a
PhD programme is conditional upon agreed criteria including:
(a) submission of an appraisal (progress) report, involving input from the student,
supervisors and department;
(b) evidence, confirmed in the appraisal (progress) report, that the student has:
(i) attended the annual faculty-based progress briefing session;
(ii) reviewed/revised their DNA;
(iii) completed any additional training as agreed;
(iv) Confirmed that:
• Ethical approval for research has been obtained in writing via their
Faculty Research Ethics Committee;
• Ethical review is ongoing where research has not yet commenced; or
• Ethical approval is not required for the scope of the research and
this has been explicitly confirmed in writing and recorded via the
appraisal form;
(v) been offered adequate supervision (as outlined in the University’s Code
of Practice for Research students), accepted it, and attended supervisory
sessions;
(vi) agreed a realistic completion timetable with their supervisors;
(vii) demonstrated sufficient progress with their research/thesis; and
(viii) any additional requirements previously agreed.
PR 2.4.6 Where students fail to meet the criteria for continued registration they will be referred
to the Standing Academic Committee by the academic department with a
recommendation for exclusion from the programme. Students who have been excluded
for failing to make satisfactory progress may appeal against the exclusion under the
procedures for Academic Appeals as defined in the chapter on Academic Appeals.
PR 2.4.7 During the first six months of the second year (or part-time equivalents) any student
whose PhD registration has not yet been confirmed will be referred to the PhD
Confirmation Panel (see PR 2.5.3 below).
PR 2.5 CONFIRMATION OF PHD STATUS
PR 2.5.1 Each programme/department shall publish clear information for students, approved by
faculty, on the procedures for confirmation of PhD. A student supervised in more than
one department shall follow the procedures used by the administrating department. The
make-up of confirmation panels should be approved by the HoD or nominated deputy
Version 1.1 7
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
with suitable regard to avoid conflict of interest and the relevant experience and nature
of the academic contract of the nominated panellists.
PR 2.5.2 The published procedures should include details of:
(a) membership of the panel;
(b) volume, level and type of work to be submitted as evidence to the panel and
justified in terms of the nature of the PhD to be awarded;
(c) normal expected period in which a student should expect to have their PhD
registration status confirmed, bearing in mind the mode of study, periods of
suspension and any other relevant factors; and
(d) a maximum of two attempts is available for a student to be considered for
confirmation of PhD status;
(e) the expectations of each panellist (supervisor, if present; chair, if present;
confirmation panellists) in terms of their input and approach;
(f) information on which forms or procedures need to be completed and followed
pre panel and post panel;
(g) how support for the student will be assessed.
While programmes/departments have some discretion in determining the above, where
there is deviation from the following guidance, this must be explicitly approved by
faculties:
(i) if, in exceptional circumstances, a confirmation panellist is also nominated as
thesis internal examiner, the HoD or nominated deputy, in signing off the thesis
supervisor form, must consider that there is no material advantage or
disadvantage to this for the student and the existing form will need to be
changed to reflect this;
(ii) there should be at least one independent panellist (i.e. neither a supervisor or a
member of staff currently acting as part of a student’s supervisory panel);
(iii) where a supervisor is present for the confirmation panel, at least part of the
panel discussion should take place without the supervisory team to enable
discussions around the suitability of the current supervisory approach;
(iv) where a second confirmation panel is required for a candidate, this must be
both independently chaired and recorded;
(v) as with viva recordings, recordings are only available to students in case of
appeal.
The first panel can either be recorded or independently chaired (i.e. the chair cannot be
part of the panel making the confirmation decision). Where there is no separate chair,
one of the panellists should take on the role of the chair. Where a recording is being
used, students should be given the option to pause when they discuss their supervision
Version 1.1 8
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
experiences; this is also the case when supervisors discuss the candidate if the candidate
is not present.
PR 2.5.3 The PhD confirmation panel:
(a) must normally be held no later than eighteen months after initial registration
(twenty-four months for part-time) or entry into the research phase of a PhD
with a previous taught component. Departments are responsible for ensuring
the timely completion of the PhD Confirmation Panel. If the panel is held within
twelve months of registration then the report of the panel should replace the
first year’s annual review report. Where a student’s PhD status is confirmed
after twenty-four months have elapsed (thirty-six months part-time) from initial
registration, they are liable for fees for a further twelve months from the date of
the panel (pro rata for part-time students);
(b) must see and approve evidence that the student has: attended induction,
carried out the Development Needs Analysis (DNA), completed the mandatory
Research Integrity and Ethical Research training,2 attended any additional
agreed training, devised a viable research proposal, made appropriate progress
on ethical approval requirements prior to commencing any research, and a
completion timetable approved by their supervisors;
(c) must be able to confirm that the student’s work is of appropriate quality and
standard, and the project is viable within the registration period, on the basis of
draft chapters and/or evidence of data gathered; and
(d) will have four possible recommendations – confirm as PhD; continue as a
probationary PhD student; transfer to MPhil; exclusion.
PR 2.5.4 Students not successful in receiving confirmation of PhD status may appeal against the
recommendation under the procedures for Academic Appeals as defined in the chapter
on Academic Appeals.
PR 2.6 SUBMISSION OF THESIS
PR 2.6.1 The decision to submit a thesis for examination is taken by the student, although the
opinion of the supervisor should be considered.
PR 2.6.2 A candidate shall make a declaration that the thesis is their own work and has not been
submitted by this candidate in substantially the same form for the award of a higher
degree elsewhere. Any sections of the thesis which have been published, or submitted
for a higher degree elsewhere, shall be clearly identified. If the thesis is, in whole or in
part, the result of joint research, a statement indicating the nature of the candidate’s
contribution to that research shall be included, confirmed by either the supervisor(s), or
the principal author of the material(s) accepted for publication.
2 For the avoidance of doubt, a student cannot be confirmed as a PhD candidate without having completed
both the Research Integrity and Ethical Research training.
Version 1.1 9
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
PR 2.6.3 A candidate shall also make a declaration that either: ethical approval has been granted
for the research presented, or that ethical approval was confirmed as not being
necessary for the research presented.
PR 2.7 FORMAT OF THESIS
PR 2.7.1 A thesis for the degree of PhD shall not normally exceed 80,000 words (see Appendix 2
for full details of specific material to be included and excluded within the word count).
A candidate, with the support of their supervisor, may apply for exceptional permission
to exceed the word limit, which approval may be granted by the body or officer with
delegated authority from Senate.
PR 2.7.2 The thesis shall be written in English. A candidate, with the support of their supervisor
and Head of Department, may apply for exceptional permission to present the thesis in
whole or in part in another language, and approval may be granted by the body or
officer with delegated authority from Senate.
PR 2.7.3 Where agreed, a candidate for the degree of PhD may submit the thesis in any of the
following formats:
(a) single volume written thesis;
(b) multi-part thesis comprised of articles or papers; and
(c) multimodal thesis comprised of written, and practical and/or creative elements.
See Appendices 2 and 3 for further details and regulations relating to these formats.
Note: having received agreement to submit with a specific format, a student cannot opt
to subsequently switch between formats without having first secured further agreement
from their academic department.
PR 2.7.4 A copy of any thesis relating to the award of a research degree made by Lancaster
University must be deposited with the University at the prescribed time. For details on
the format of submission, see Appendix 2.
PR 2.8 EXAMINATION
PR 2.8.1 Examiners (including at least one External Examiner) shall be appointed by the body or
officer with delegated authority from Senate on the nomination of the department(s)
concerned (see PR 5: Appointment of Examiners (All Research Degrees)). Two External
Examiners shall be appointed for theses submitted by candidates who qualify for
remission of fees as members of staff, unless in exceptional circumstances the body or
officer with delegated authority from Senate decides otherwise. The candidate's
supervisor shall not act as an examiner.
PR 2.8.2 Each examiner shall report independently on the thesis before the oral, or any other
examination required by the examiners, takes place and submit the report to the
University prior to the examination. All examiners shall participate in the oral
examination. The examiners may, at their discretion, invite the student's supervisor to
be present at the oral examination. After the oral examination, each examiner shall
report on the examination and make a recommendation based on both the report on
Version 1.1 10
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
the thesis and on the evidence from the oral, and any other examinations that have
taken place.
PR 2.9 EXAMINATION OUTCOMES
PR 2.9.1 The examiners shall make one of the following recommendations. Where a time period
is specified for undertaking additional work on the thesis, this will commence from the
date of notification of the decision by Student and Programme Administration.
(a) That the degree of PhD be awarded immediately: a pass with no corrections.
(b) That the degree of PhD be awarded immediately: a pass with very minor
corrections, i.e. typographical or presentational corrections only. The candidate
is to make the very minor corrections required within one month prior to
submission of the final version of the thesis and there is no requirement for
these to be approved by the internal or the external examiner.
(c) That the degree of PhD be awarded subject to minor amendments being made
within three months. ‘Minor amendments’ refers to e.g. a number of significant
stylistic errors such as needing to clarify or rephrase points, or add/edit blocks of
text. There will be no requirement to conduct further research or to undertake
substantial further work. The amendments must be approved by the internal
examiner. A second oral examination is not required.
(d) That the degree of PhD be awarded subject to major amendments being made
within six months: there is a requirement for significant further work, but there
is not a requirement for a second oral examination. Changes may include, but
are not limited to: the addition of substantial new material; rewriting and
editing sections of the thesis; re-analysis of existing data. The amendments
must be approved by either the internal examiner or the internal and the
external examiner, as agreed by the examiners. A second oral examination is
not required.
(e) That the degree of PhD should not be awarded but that the candidate should be
permitted to revise and resubmit the thesis within twelve months for the
degree of PhD: the requirements for the degree of PhD have not been met.
Changes may include, but are not limited to: extensive rewriting and editing
sections of, or the whole of, the thesis; carrying out further research and/or
experimental work. The revisions must be approved by both the internal and
the external examiner. There is an expectation that a second viva will be held
but the examiners can exceptionally discount this where they are satisfied that it
is not necessary.
(f) That the degree of MPhil be awarded immediately: the requirements for the
degree of PhD have not been met but the requirements for the MPhil have been
met, with no or very minor corrections, i.e. typographical or presentational
corrections only. The candidate is to make very minor corrections, if required,
within one month prior to submission of the final version of the thesis and there
is no requirement for these to be approved by the internal or the external
examiner.
Version 1.1 11
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
(g) That the degree of MPhil be awarded subject to minor amendments being made
within three months: the requirements for the degree of PhD have not been
met but the requirements for the MPhil have been met with minor
amendments, e.g. a number of significant stylistic errors such as needing to
clarify or rephrase points, or add/edit blocks of text. There will be no
requirement to conduct further research or to undertake substantial further
work. The amendments must be approved by the internal examiner. A second
oral examination is not required.
(h) That the candidate be permitted to revise and resubmit the thesis within twelve
months for the degree of MPhil: the requirements for the degree of PhD have
not been met but the candidate is permitted to submit a revised thesis for the
lower award. Changes may include, but are not limited to: extensive editorial
corrections and revisions; rewriting a part, parts, or the whole of the thesis;
carrying out further research or experimental work. The revisions must be
approved by both the internal and the external examiner. The examiners will
determine if a second oral examination is required.
PR 2.9.2 Outcomes (f), (g) and (h) above are not available for the DClinPsy and MD programmes.
PR 2.9.3 Students may appeal against the outcome of the examination under the procedures for
Academic Appeals as defined in the chapter on Academic Appeals.
PR 2.9.4 Students given the opportunity to make corrections or amendments shall normally be
given only one opportunity to make the changes required as specified by the examiners.
PR 2.9.5 Examiners' reports and recommendations will be considered by the body or officer with
delegated authority from Senate on behalf of the Committee of the Senate.
PR 2.10 DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN EXAMINERS ON FIRST SUBMISSION OF THESIS
PR 2.10.1 If there is no unanimity among the recommendations from the examiners of the thesis
at the first submission the following procedure shall be adopted.
PR 2.10.2 In the first instance, Student and Programme Administration shall consult with the
examiners to see whether an agreed recommendation can be drawn up.
PR 2.10.3 If agreement is not achieved, the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate
may at their discretion appoint one or more additional external examiners or may
determine other action as appropriate. Any additional examiners shall be informed that
the examiners appointed initially have submitted conflicting recommendations but shall
not be told the identity of these examiners nor their specific recommendations. Unless
the additional examiners recommend that the candidate pass, a further oral
examination must be held. The student's supervisor or the departmental tutor for
research students shall attend this examination as an observer.
PR 2.10.4 A recommendation (see the list of recommendations at PR 2.9.1) based on the reports
from all of the examiners shall be made by the body or officer with delegated authority
from Senate to the Committee of Senate. If this recommendation is for re-submission of
the thesis it shall include the nomination of the panel of examiners for the resubmitted
thesis.

candidate's supervisor shall not act as an examiner.
PR 3.7.2 Each examiner shall make an independent report on the thesis. These reports shall be
written before any oral or any other examination required by the examiners takes place
and submitted to Student and Programme Administration prior to the examination. All
examiners shall participate in any oral examination. Each examiner shall then make a
recommendation based on both the report on the thesis and on the evidence from the
oral examination. The examiners may at their discretion invite the student's supervisor
to be present at the oral examination.
PR 3.7.3 An oral examination is required. The examiners shall have discretion whether or not to
hold an oral examination on a resubmitted thesis.
PR 3.8 EXAMINATION OUTCOMES
PR 3.8.1 The examiners shall make one of the following recommendations:
(a) That the degree of MPhil be awarded immediately with no or very minor
corrections, i.e. typographical or presentational corrections only. The candidate
is to make very minor corrections, if required, within one month prior to
submission of the final version of the thesis and there is no requirement for
these to be approved by the internal/external examiners.

MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
a second viva will be held but the examiners can exceptionally discount this
where they are satisfied that it is not necessary.
(d) That the degree of MPhil should not be awarded but that the candidate should
be permitted to revise and resubmit the thesis within twelve months for the
degree of MPhil: the requirements for the degree of MPhil have not been met.
Changes may include, but are not limited to: extensive rewriting and editing
sections of, or the whole of, the thesis; carrying out further research and/or
experimental work. The revisions must be approved by both the internal and
the external examiner. There is an expectation that a second viva will be held
but the examiners can exceptionally discount this where they are satisfied that it
is not necessary.

at the first submission the following procedure shall be adopted.
PR 3.9.2 In the first instance, the Head of Assessment, Awards and Timetabling shall consult with
the examiners to see whether an agreed recommendation can be drawn up.
PR 3.9.3 If agreement is not achieved, the body and officer with delegated authority from Senate
may at their discretion appoint one or more additional external examiners or may
determine other action as appropriate. Any additional examiners shall be informed that
the examiners appointed initially have submitted conflicting recommendations but shall
not be told the identity of these examiners nor their specific recommendations. Unless
the additional examiners recommend that the candidate pass, a further oral
examination must be held. The student's supervisor or the departmental tutor for
research students shall attend this examination as an observer.
PR 3.9.4 A recommendation (see recommendations listed at PR 3.8.1) based on the reports from
all of the examiners shall be made by the body or officer with delegated authority from

PR 5 APPOINTMENT OF EXAMINERS (ALL RESEARCH DEGREES)
PR 5.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
PR 5.1.1 All research students, whether studying towards the MPhil or PhD, submit a thesis for
examination which is assessed by examiners appointed specifically according to the
student’s area of study. As well as the assessment of the work itself, all PhD, MPhil and
MA/MSc by Research students undergo an oral examination.
PR 5.1.2 There shall always be at least one internal examiner and one external examiner. If a
student has had a connection with the department or university beyond that of being a
research student, i.e. as a member of staff or a research assistant, then a second
external examiner is required. If a suitable internal examiner cannot be found or if only
the supervisor would be suitable, then a second external examiner would also be
required.
PR 5.2 EXTERNAL EXAMINERS: ELIGIBILITY AND APPOINTMENT
PR 5.2.1 The external examiner shall normally be a senior academic from another institution
qualified to assess the thesis within its own field and to compare its quality with work of
MPhil/PhD standard at other British universities although where appropriate an
examiner from outside the university sector may be appointed.
PR 5.2.2 All external examiner(s) shall:
(a) be competent in the area of work being examined;
(b) be experienced in research, including having published;
(c) be experienced in the examination of research students.
PR 5.2.3 Where it is deemed to be appropriate to appoint an examiner from outside the
university sector, the person nominated must have an understanding of the examination
process, and if they have not previously examined a research student, then the internal
examiner must be widely experienced as an examiner.
PR 5.2.4 The University shall appoint appropriate external examiners on the nomination of heads
of departments and subject to approval by the body or officer with delegated authority
from Senate on behalf of the Committee of Senate.
PR 5.3 INTERNAL EXAMINERS: ELIGIBILITY AND APPOINTMENT
PR 5.3.1 Internal examiners shall be members of staff from either the same department or an
area cognate to the student’s field of research. Where the internal examiner is not an
expert in the precise field of research they shall be acquainted with the broad area
within which it falls. In addition, the internal examiner should normally hold a degree at
least equivalent to that for which the student is being examined, and should be
experienced in research. Lancaster University Guidance for the Examination of Research
Degrees is available online. The Guidance confirms that the internal examiner must be
and be seen to be independent; and thus wherever practicable they should not have
Version 1.1 25

Postgraduate Research Regulations
played any significant role in either the supervision of the student or the assessment of
the student during their studies.
PR 5.4 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
PR 5.4.1 The student’s supervisor should not normally act as the internal examiner. If the
supervisor has to act as internal examiner, then an additional examiner (internal or
external) shall be appointed.
PR 5.4.2 An external examiner shall not normally have any conflict of interest when appointed.
Examples of conflicts of interest to avoid include external examiners who:
(a) have had any previous specific contact with the student;
(b) have been a former member of Lancaster’s staff or have had a formal
connection with the student’s department within the last five years;
(c) have been a student of Lancaster University or one of its collaborative partners
within the last five years;
(d) have examined more than four Lancaster University research students within
the last five years;
(e) be a close relative or be otherwise closely connected with any other party to the
examination;
(f) have co-authored or held a research grant with a supervisor of the student being

publication.
MULTIMODAL RESEARCH DEGREES
13. Subject to discussion and approval within departments, a candidate for the degree of PhD or
MPhil may submit a multimodal thesis comprised of two components:
(a) a written thesis; and
(b) a substantial practical work (e.g. a theatrical production, installation, exhibition of
work, recital, lecture-recital, or some other performative or participatory event, a
play, a translation, a design, computer software, creative writing, a model or
prototype, a series of conceptual works).
14. The practical and written components, which interdependently constitute the “thesis” as
such, will be evaluated in relation to each other after the written component has been
submitted.
15. The examiners will evaluate the practical and written components according to the extent to
which they both respond to a single list of specific and explicit research questions which
should be submitted prior to the presentation of the practical component.
16. The practical component must negotiate and articulate a response to the research questions
through an appropriate level of skill in the manipulation of the materials of production or
event. For the degree of PhD, the practical component, which can consist of a minor and a
major submission, should normally be of an appropriate professional standard.
17 If the practical component involves the creation of a performance event/works or exhibition
of work:
(a) the board of examiners is required to attend the performance, event or exhibition;
(b) an audiovisual record of that event/work, or even live performances of that work on
tour, will not be acceptable in lieu of a live performance or event at a designated
Version 1.1 37
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
venue unless the medium of audiovisual recording, the contingencies of touring, or
the absence of locality, are factored into the research topic.
18. A permanent record of the practical component should normally be deposited with the
written thesis in the University Library.
19. Just as the examiners can, according to the rules of the University, require the candidate to
amend or revise a written thesis in part of in whole as a condition of an award, so they can
also require the candidate to amend or revise the practical component in part or in whole,
but only on the condition that they are not satisfied that any shortcomings in the practical
submission can be compensated or accounted for in the written thesis. In such a case, the
examiners should, wherever possible, set a cost-effective practical assignment that
addresses their concerns rather than demand a revision of the original practical work in its
entirety.
20. The written thesis must be of a quality commensurate with the usual standards set for MPhil
or PhD, but need not be of the same length. Departments will advise each candidate on the
exact minimum length of the written thesis. For a 50/50 split assessment the written thesis
should not normally exceed 40,000 words for a PhD and 20,000 words for an MPhil (noting
the word length inclusions and exclusions detailed in Appendix 2). In other cases (e.g. 70/30
thesis/practical split) the word count will be agreed by the supervisor, the appropriate
transfer panel and the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate. The length of
the written thesis should normally be agreed on a proportionate basis.
DOCTOR OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY (DCLINPSY)
21. In addition to the normal requirements for admission and award, a candidate shall maintain
throughout the period of study their registration with the British Psychological Society.
22. A candidate shall register at the outset for a DClinPsy qualification and undertake taught
courses and clinical placements specified by the department of registration. Such courses
shall normally be completed within thirty-six months of first registration.
23. Successful completion of each course and placement is both qualificatory and progressional.
A candidate who fails to satisfy the requirements of the scheme of assessment within the
specified opportunities for examination and re-examination shall be required to withdraw.
Students may appeal against this decision under the procedures for Academic Appeals.
24. A candidate who successfully completes all the required courses and placements shall,
normally by early June of the third year of study, submit for examination a dissertation. The
dissertation shall not exceed 56,000 words in length, inclusive of references and appendices.
A successful candidate for the degree of DClinPsy shall show convincing evidence of the
capacity to pursue scholarly research or scholarship, the results of which shall be embodied
in a dissertation which makes an original contribution to knowledge and contains material of
a standard appropriate for scholarly publication. External examiners for the thesis will be
competent in the area of clinical psychology being examined and may be engaged by the
Version 1.1 38
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
University to examine up to four DClinPsy candidates per year over a maximum period of up
to four years.6
DOCTOR OF MEDICINE (MD)
25. Eligibility: the award of MD is at doctoral level, and shall normally be taken after a candidate
can demonstrate suitable clinical experience as an element of the admissions process.
26. Level: the Lancaster MD shall be a research degree that contains research conducted at the
doctoral level, both in terms of the publishable quality of research that is expected in the
thesis, and when viewed alongside the QAA's FHEQ level descriptors. It shall be comparable
in level to the Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy).
27. Content: the degree will be awarded for research by thesis or by publication. The thesis
should contain original work of publishable quality, but not necessarily in a publishable
format. An award based on published work (defined as papers produced during registration)
will use the same criteria as the University's existing multi-part thesis format.
28. Duration: candidates will demonstrate, as an element of admissions, suitable prior
experience in their chosen area of clinical study so as to be able to provide a basis for
research equivalent to one-year of doctoral research; thereafter there will be a two-year
minimum period of registration, full-time (or equivalent); exceptionally less for MD by
published work.
29. Entry requirements: applicants must hold a medical or dental qualification which is
recognised by the General Medical/Dental Council for the United Kingdom, shall have held
this qualification for at least three years, by the date of submission, and shall be employed
during their period of registration in appropriate clinical or scientific work in hospitals or
institutions associated with the University.
30. Admission: The University shall only admit students for whom it is able to provide adequate
and appropriate academic supervision. Each application shall be considered by an MD
admissions panel, whose members shall include the potential supervisor(s) and the relevant
head of department.
31. Initial registration: Students shall be initially registered for MSc by Research and the
registration shall be transferred to MD on satisfactory completion of the first year, based on
evidence of research performance commensurate with doctoral level of study, judged by a
written report and a viva voce examination.
32. Supervision: Each student shall be allocated to a supervisor by the department, who shall
normally be an academic member of staff of the University, and who shall carry out the
normal duties of a supervisor. In addition the faculty shall, where appropriate, arrange for
each student to have access to clinical supervision, normally through the clinical institution
where the student is undertaking their research.
6 The alternative arrangements for DClinPsy external examiner appointments shall be reviewed prior to the
2026/27 academic year to confirm continued suitability and effectiveness.
Version 1.1 39
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
33. Research skills: Each student shall be provided with opportunities to develop generic
research skills including taking appropriate postgraduate taught modules, which shall be
defined by the principal supervisor in consultation with the student. This taught element
shall not form part of the formal assessment for the award of MD.
MULTI-PART THESES COMPRISED OF PAPERS AND ARTICLES
34. The candidate’s department of registration shall maintain and provide guidelines on the
multi-part format(s) judged appropriate to the discipline, for the information of students,
supervisors and examiners. A department must obtain approval of its guidelines by the
faculty committee responsible for postgraduate provision.
Notes:
(a) a candidate is encouraged to seek advice within their department of registration
that the multi-part format is more appropriate for the research project and that they
can take full advantage of the format;
(b) supervising departments are encouraged to seek, where practicable, the advice of
the External Examiner(s) with respect to the format proposed; and
(c) the guidelines shall form the basis of agreement between the student, supervisor
and head of department (or their nominee) on the multi-part format to be employed
in the submission.
35. The thesis shall include original, researched materials, of which a significant proportion shall
be derived from original research undertaken after the date of first registration.
Notes: it is anticipated that at the point of thesis submission materials be:
(a) already published; and/or
(b) accepted for publication; and/or
(c) submitted for publication in externally refereed contexts such as journals,
conference proceedings and on-line sites, and may include materials which are
solely and/or partly authored by the candidate.
It is not a requirement that all materials be published or accepted or submitted for
publication, prior to the submission of the thesis for examination.
36. Examiners shall satisfy themselves that the thesis as a whole meets the criteria for award of
the degree, as outlined above.
Notes: examiners:
(a) may wish to pay particular attention to satisfying themselves that of any multi-
authored materials included, a significant proportion is the work principally of the
candidate; and
(b) are reminded of the freedom to specify additional tests as part of the examination.

EUROPEAN DOCTORATE
37. The European Doctorate is a qualification that was created by the Confederation of EU
Rectors’ Conference (now the European University Association) and provides the
opportunity to study for a qualification which meets the criteria which are commonly
understood to be met in a doctorate, using examination procedures that are widely
recognised across Europe, involving an ability to work in more than one language, and
entailing periods of time spent working in institution across more than one EU member
state.
38. The characteristics of the European Doctorate are those of the traditional Lancaster PhD
with the following amendments.
(a) The thesis should be reviewed by at least two academics from different higher
education institutions in different EU countries, excluding the UK. At least one
member of the exam board should come from an EU country other than the UK. In
the Lancaster context, this requirement would most easily be implemented by
having two External Examiners at the board from EU countries other than the UK.
(b) Part of the defence must take place in one of the official languages of the EU other
than English.
(c) The thesis must have been prepared partly as a result of a research period of at least
one term spent at an institution in an EU country other than the UK.
39. The European doctorate is available in any of the areas in which the PhD is currently
available at Lancaster, and is offered under the title of European Doctorate in XXXX, with
postnominal letters of PhD.
DSc and DLitt
40. To be eligible for the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc) or of Doctor of Letters (DLitt),
candidates shall be either graduates of the University, or members of staff of the University,
whose record of published work and research shows conspicuous ability and originality and
constitutes a distinguished and sustained achievement.
41. Any person who wishes to be considered for the award of the degree of DSc/DLitt shall
submit a formal written letter of application to the Head of Student and Programme
Administration, stating in outline on what basis the award is sought and what evidence in
support of the application is available. Such letters of application may be submitted at any
time.
42. As soon as possible after the letter of application has been submitted, the Head of Student
and Programme Administration, acting on the advice of the relevant faculty dean, shall
recommend to the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate an appropriate
senior academic member of staff of the University or equivalent with appropriate specialist
knowledge of and expertise in the field, to consider the information supplied.
43. The member of staff appointed shall consider whether a prima facie case for formal
examination exists and shall recommend either:
Version 1.1 41
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
(a) that the application proceed, in which case the procedure to be followed is that
specified below; or
(b) that the application is not suitable for examination, in which case the procedure to
be followed is that specified below.
44. Where a recommendation for formal examination to proceed is made, the member of staff
shall recommend persons who might be appointed as examiners. The body or officer with
delegated authority from Senate, acting on behalf of the Committee of Senate on the advice
of the Head of Student and Programme Administration, shall approve the appointment of
not fewer that two independent External Examiners, with expertise in the field, one of
whom shall be the lead examiner. The officer with delegated authority from Senate, or their
nominee, shall act as the internal examiner.
45. The Head of Student and Programme Administration shall inform the applicant of the
appointment of examiners, of what additional material in support of the application is
required, and of the fee to be paid prior to the examination.
46. Where a recommendation is made that the application is not suitable for examination, the
Head of Student and Programme Administration shall advise the candidate of this
recommendation.
47. In such cases the candidate may:
(a) withdraw the application, whereupon no fee shall be payable;
(b) elect to proceed with the examination, and be liable for payment of the full fee,
subject to confirmation by the Head of Student and Programme Administration that
appropriate External Examiners are available and willing to act. In the absence of
such confirmation the application will lapse.
PHD BY PUBLISHED WORK
Award criteria
48. To be awarded a PhD by Published Work a candidate must show that their work makes a
significant contribution to knowledge in a particular field. The publications must also
provide evidence of the capacity of the candidate to pursue further research, representing a
coherent contribution to research in a given field and demonstrating a depth of scholarship
and originality comparable with that required in a PhD thesis. The material submitted shall
be sufficiently extensive as to provide convincing evidence that the research constitutes a
substantial contribution to knowledge or scholarship.
Admissions criteria
49. Candidates for the degree of PhD by submission of published work must be:
(a) members or past members of staff at Lancaster University or at one of Lancaster
University's associated institutions (University of Cumbria, Blackburn College, and
Blackpool and The Fylde College); or
Version 1.1 42
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
(b) alumni of Lancaster University or of one of Lancaster University's associated
institutions.
50. In order to be eligible for consideration, alumni must be graduates of at least five years'
standing and have already obtained a Master’s degree or show evidence of having received
research training or equivalent experience. In exceptional circumstances, other candidates
may also be considered.
Applications and registration
51. Applications may be made at any time. A letter of application should be accompanied by:
(a) a list of the publications to be submitted: these may include refereed articles,
authored chapters, authored books, and edited works. They may not include course
readers, internally published material or unpublished seminar/conference papers;
and
(b) a supporting paper: this should summarise each publication submitted, outline their
interrelationship, give a critical review of the current state of knowledge and
research in the applicant's field and indicate how their work has contributed to the
field. It should also comment on the standing of any journals and the reception of
the publications as indicated by citations and reviews.
52. The candidate's application shall first be considered by either a Faculty’s Associate Dean for
Research or Postgraduate Studies (according to which officer has responsibility for PhD
study), in consultation with the Head of the appropriate department. If the application is
accepted, the applicant will then be registered to submit for the degree of PhD by Published
Work, and an internal adviser will be appointed by the Head of Department to assist the
candidate. A minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months are
allowed before submission.
Examination
53. Candidate shall submit for examination:
(a) three copies, in published form, of each item forming part of the work on which the
application for the degree by published work is based. Permission to include work in
manuscript, but which has been accepted for publication, may be granted;
(b) four copies of the supporting paper, modified, if necessary after consultation with
the advisor;
(c) a statement as to what part if any of the material has been submitted for a degree
or other qualification in this or any other University or other institution, explaining
the reason for its inclusion and, if joint work is submitted, what part of it is the
candidate's contribution.
54. A panel of examiners consisting of one internal and two External Examiners shall be
appointed by the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate on behalf of the
Committee of the Senate on the nomination of the department(s) concerned. The internal
examiner will not normally have been appointed as adviser to the candidate. An oral
examination will normally be held for the degree, but this requirement may be waived with
Version 1.1 43
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
the approval of the body or officer with delegated authority from Senate provided that all
the examiners are in agreement.
55. The examiners shall make one of the following recommendations:
(a) that the degree of PhD by published work be awarded;
(b) that the degree be awarded subject to specified revisions of the supporting paper;
or
(c) that the degree be not awarded.
56. The examiners may not recommend the award of a lower degree.
57. A candidate whose work has been found unacceptable for the award of the degree may be
permitted to resubmit only after completing re-registration; normally, this would be no
earlier than two years after the original submission.
58. Examiners' reports and recommendations are considered by the body or officer with
delegated authority from Senate on behalf of the Committee of the Senate, and a decision
given to the candidate within one month of the oral examination.

MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
APPENDIX 4: FRAMEWORK FOR THE RESEARCH DEGREE VIVA
The guidance set out below, and approved by the Senate, is designed to best protect the interests of
all participants in the process, for any research degree examination leading to a Lancaster award
(even when a viva voce is held away from Lancaster).
1. Definition of the viva voce
1.1 A viva voce is an oral examination of a research degree thesis, and of the student who wrote
it, which is normally conducted in person, at Lancaster, by an internal and an external
examiner.
1.2 The first stage of the examination is the review of the student’s thesis. Student and
Programme Administration is responsible for sending a copy of the thesis to each examiner.
The examiners independently read the thesis and write a Pre-Viva Voce report on it, with
comments about its contribution to the field, its strengths and weaknesses, and possibly a
range of points which they will raise at the viva voce.
2. Status of the viva voce
2.1 The viva voce is a compulsory part of all research degree examinations unless otherwise
specified in the regulations however excellent or poor the thesis may be. The student
always has the right to defend their work to the examiners.
2.2 It is not possible under current regulations for a student to fail a research degree outright
without undertaking a viva voce.
3. Role of each participant in the viva voce
3.1 The external examiner(s): the role of the external examiner(s) (someone not connected with
the University) is to assess the quality of the submission and help to uphold the quality of
the degree in the UK.
3.2 In certain circumstances, there may be a third examiner, external to the University, involved
to ensure impartiality. This would happen if:
(a) the student is a member of staff, or holds a temporary teaching or research contract
at the University;
(b) the student is being examined for a Ph.D. by Published Work;
(c) the student’s supervisor is acting also as the internal examiner.
3.3 The internal examiner(s): the role of the internal examiner(s) is to assess the quality of the
submission and help to uphold the quality of a Lancaster award. The role is similar to that of
the external examiner(s), and it has equal status and standing. It is not the role of the
internal examiner to protect the student, to be the student’s friend, and/or to defend the
supervisor, department or institution against criticism from the external examiner(s), nor to
act as chair in the viva voce (unless the department decides not to have an independent
chair: see clause 6.1). The internal examiner must be and be seen to be independent; and
thus wherever practicable they should not have played any significant role in either the
Version 1.1 45
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
supervision of the student or the assessment of the student during their studies (e.g. annual
progress review, confirmation panel).
3.4 The independent chair: the role of the independent chair is to be an observer and manager
of the meeting, and to ensure that procedures are followed properly. The chair does not
need to be a subject specialist, does not need to have read the thesis, and is not directly
involved in examining it. If a department decides not to have an independent chair (see
clause 6.1), it must arrange for an audio record of the viva voce to be made and retained
(see clause 7). If there is no independent chair, the internal examiner will normally be
expected to chair the viva voce. There should always be an independent chair where the
internal and/or external examiners are inexperienced (usually defined as having participated
in less than two vivas at the appropriate level).
3.5 The student: the role of the student is to discuss, explain and defend their work as
represented in the thesis being examined, to be open to critical appraisal by the examiners,
and to be prepared and willing to engage in a dialogue with the examiners about the
substance and field of enquiry of the thesis.
3.6 The supervisor(s): whether the supervisor is present throughout the viva voce (see clause
5.1 (a)), or attends at the end when the examiner’s report to the student their decision
about the outcome of the examination, their role is to be a silent witness to the proceedings,
and through that to be able to provide feedback to and advise the student after the viva
voce is completed.
4. Student preparation for the viva voce
4.1 All students should be allowed and encouraged to acquire relevant experience in defending
the thesis, in advance of the viva voce, including:
(a) by robust interrogation of their work and progress during each annual appraisal and
at the confirmation panel;
(b) by being given special training for the viva voce (including a mock viva voce). This is
probably best done by their faculty (e.g. through the faculty training programmes).
4.2 It would be inappropriate for the chair and/or internal examiner(s) to be directly involved in
the student’s training for the viva voce.
5. Membership of viva voce panel
5.1 Supervisor
(a) The student’s supervisor(s) may attend the viva voce with the approval of the
examiners and the student.
(b) If not present throughout the viva voce, the supervisor(s) may be invited to attend
the final stage of the viva voce when the examiners report their decision to the
student, unless the student advises the chair, before the viva voce, that they would
prefer the supervisor not to attend.
(c) If present, the supervisor(s) must remain silent and impassive, unless specifically
invited to comment on specific points, by the examiners, through the chair.
Version 1.1 46
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
5.2 Independent chair
(a) There should normally be an independent chair present throughout the viva voce
(see clause 6.1). The independent chair should normally be a member of academic
staff (or an emeritus member) at the level of Senior Lecturer or above, OR who has
experience of conducting at least three research degree vivas as an examiner and
has supervised at least one student to completion. The chair should not be an
examiner or supervisor of the student being examined.
(b) The independent chair should be selected by the relevant head of department or
their nominee.
(c) The chair must be familiar with this guidance, and with the Regulations for Higher
Degrees of the University.
(d) No member of staff should normally be expected to serve as independent chair on
more than one viva voce per term (three per year).
6. Chair and/or audio record
6.1 For examinations (whether in-person or online), departments have discretion to decide, on a
case-by-case basis, whether to have an independent chair (see clause 5.2) and/or to keep an
audio record (see clause 7.1) of the viva voce proceedings. They must adopt at least one of
the two.
6.2 An independent chair and an audio record do not serve the same purpose, so departments
need to give careful thought about which one(s) they will adopt in each case.
6.3 The decisions about the independent chair and the audio record must be notified to Student
and Programme Administration at the time of appointment of the internal and external
examiners.
7. Record keeping
7.1 Departments have discretion not to make an audio record of a particular viva voce, provided
they appoint an independent chair (see clause 6.1).
7.2 If the department decides that it is appropriate to record a viva voce on audio tape or
minidisk, the person taking the chair at the viva voce should ensure that the audio record is
made and lodged with Student and Programme Administration.
7.3 Nothing will be done with the recording (no one will listen to it) unless it is to be used as
evidence in the event of an appeal/complaint.
7.4 The recording should normally be kept for no longer than twelve months after the viva voce,
unless the student has made an appeal/complaint against the decision of the examiners (in
which case the recording should be kept until the end of the appeal/complaint process).
Version 1.1 47
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
8. Timing and arrangements
8.1 The maximum period of time between submission of thesis by student and the date of the
viva voce examination should normally be three months.
8.2 The postgraduate director in the student’s department is responsible for making
arrangements for the viva voce (including day, time, location and name of the independent
chair if there is one), and for communicating this information to the examiners, the student,
the chair and the supervisor(s).
8.3 Appropriate arrangements should be made available for disabled students, on the same
basis as for other forms of University assessments, in order to provide an equal opportunity
to defend the thesis.
8.4 The examiners, chair and student should be given as much notice as possible about the day
and time of the viva voce, and this should normally be not less than two weeks prior to the
appointed date.
8.5 The chair is responsible for making sure that seating arrangements in the viva voce room are
appropriate for dialogue between the participants.
8.6 Video-conferencing of a viva voce examination, with either the candidate or an examiner at
a remote location, is permissible as long as the student is not disadvantaged by its use, and
as long as all parties consent to it. The University retains the right to refuse a request to use
video-conferencing; such a refusal will not constitute grounds for appeal. Guidance for the
conduct of such a viva voce examination is in Appendix 5.
8.7 The internal examiner should collate written guidance from all the examiners on required
changes to the thesis to be undertaken within a reasonable period of time after the viva
voce. For minor corrections the information should normally be collated within two weeks;
for major corrections or revisions to the thesis within one month.
8.8 The internal examiner should forward the written guidance from the examiners to the
student, and send a copy to Student and Programme Administration, without delay.
8.9 The period for corrections or revisions to the thesis commences on the day written
notification of the decision of the examiners is sent to the student by Student and
Programme Administration.
9. Examiners’ written report
9.1 Examiners are required to provide written reports on the thesis before the viva voce
examination, to establish that they have read the thesis before the viva voce, and to record
their initial judgements formed on the basis of reading the thesis.
9.2 Examiners are required to write separate such reports independently of each other, and
send them to Student and Programme Administration, before they exchange views and
compare notes with the other examiners.
9.3 Examiners should be given the opportunity (but not be required) in such reports to give a
provisional decision about the outcome of the examination.
Version 1.1 48
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
9.4 The reports should only be seen before the viva voce by administrative staff who have no
vested interest in the outcome of the examination.
9.5 Under Data Protection legislation, the student has no right of access to the reports before
the examination process is complete.
10. The purpose of the viva voce examination
10.1 The viva voce is an opportunity for the student to defend the thesis.
10.2 It is not a purpose of the viva voce to test the student’s command of spoken English in what
is often a stressful situation. This is particularly important for students whose first language
is not English, and for some disabled students.
10.3 The viva voce should normally include the assessment of the student’s ability to:
(a) locate their research in the broader context;
(b) display detailed knowledge of the thesis;
(c) authenticate the work (i.e. to prove that it is the student’s own work).
10.4 Criterion (a) should be explicitly commented on in the examiners' reports.
10.5 Criteria (a) to (c) should be explicitly evaluated during the viva voce.
10.6 It is appropriate in the viva voce to ask questions about the originality of the thesis, and
about the contribution the thesis makes to knowledge.
10.7 The student should also be able to defend the methodology and conclusions of the thesis,
and display awareness of the limitations of the thesis, in the viva voce.
10.8 For the viva voce to be regarded as successful, the student should satisfy the examiners that
they are worthy of the research degree, which ultimately is a matter of academic judgement
by the examiners.
11. Conduct of the viva voce
11.1 Existing University Regulations cover procedures for dealing with disagreements between
examiners.
11.2 Examiners should not normally be able to fail or refer a thesis on grounds that are not
considered with the student in the viva voce. The decision should be based on what is
discussed in the viva voce.
11.3 A recording (see clause 7) is helpful in reconstructing what was discussed in the viva voce,
and how it was discussed.
11.4 The viva voce should give the student an opportunity to defend anything the examiners
regard as problematic. It will normally be expected to touch upon the issues that the
examiners regard as important in reaching their decision about the award of the degree in
question.
Version 1.1 49
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
11.5 The student should be told by the chair at the beginning of the viva voce, that no
information about outcomes will be provided until the end of the viva voce examination,
and that no conclusions should be drawn from this. This is because to indicate or hint at
outcomes could:
(a) partly negate the value of the viva in the assessment process;
(b) compromise the ability of the examiners to change their mind during the course of
the viva voce;
(c) have a significant impact on how the student feels and responds to questioning
during the viva voce.
11.6 A typical viva voce should normally last for not less than one hour and not more than four
hours, although it is recognised that practice varies between disciplines.
11.7 Questions during the viva voce should be fair and appropriate. Fair play should be
maintained, and proper procedures should be followed.
11.8 If the chair and examiners anticipate that a viva voce is likely to last more than about two
hours, the chair should give an opportunity for a break after two hours, provided that to do
so does not disadvantage the student.
11.9 The chair shall have final decision on when the viva voce should finish, taking into account
the views of the examiners, and the need to uphold fair play and to give the student an
opportunity to defend their work.
12. Student role in the viva voce
12.1 Examiners are expected to be open-minded in their probing of the student's work, and to
approach the task in a spirit of academic integrity.
12.2 The chair should ensure that the student is given the opportunity to present a brief verbal
summary of their work (15 minutes maximum), towards the start of the viva voce, if they
wish to do so.
12.3 The chair should ensure that the student is given an appropriate right of reply to points
raised by the examiners, during and at the end of the viva voce.
12.4 If the student feels during the course of the viva voce that the questions are not fair or
appropriate, that they are being denied the right of reply, or that proper procedures are not
being followed, they should be able to call for a break, and talk privately with the chair.
12.5 If the chair grants such a time out during the viva voce, the conversation between student
and chair should not be overheard by the examiners, but it should be recorded on the audio
tape or mini-disk if the viva voce is recorded.
13. Outcome of the viva voce
13.1 Towards the end of the viva voce, the student (and supervisor(s) if present) should be asked
to leave the room while the examiners decide what outcome they think appropriate.
Version 1.1 50
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
13.2 The chair should remain present throughout the viva voce.
13.3 When the examiners have reached their decision, the student (normally accompanied by the
supervisor(s)) should then be invited back into the room, to be told (normally by the external
examiner) what the examiners will be recommending to the University.
13.4 The outcome given at the end of the viva voce is a recommendation, subject to approval by
the body or officer with delegated authority from the Committee of Senate.
14. Post-Viva Voce Reports
14.1 All examiners are required to submit a further written report after the viva voce, which
includes their judgement of the quality of the thesis and the student’s performance in the
viva voce, and contains their recommendation about the award of the degree:
(a) examiners can submit a joint report if they agree on the outcome, and if producing a
joint report is practical under the circumstances;
(b) examiners must submit separate reports if they disagree on the outcome.
14.2 Under Data Protection legislation, students have a right of access to their post-viva voce
report after Senate approval of the examiners’ recommendation is confirmed and the
examination (including any revisions) has been completed.
14.3 Any examiner may indicate that part (to be highlighted explicitly) or all of their report should
be disclosed to the student before the examiners’ recommendations are approved by the
Senate, if the examiner believes this would help the student to make appropriate
corrections or revisions.
14.4 The internal examiner is responsible for making sure that the student is made fully aware of
the examiners’ expectations in respect of which corrections or revisions are felt necessary
(see 8.6).
15. Second Viva Voce
15.1 The examiners can require a student to attend a second viva voce as part of the examination
of a revised and resubmitted thesis or where major corrections are required, but not for
minor corrections.
16. Student’s right of appeal
16.1 A student has no right of appeal against the academic judgement of the examiners. A
student may appeal, however, against the outcome of the examination under the
procedures for Academic Appeals as defined in the chapter on Academic Appeals.
16.2 All students of the University have the right to make a complaint under the Student Charter.
17. Publication of guidelines
17.1 These guidelines and criteria will be published on the University web site, and will be:
(a) given to each research degree student when submitting the thesis;
Version 1.1 51
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
(b) given to the examiners on appointment, to the chair on designation, and to the
supervisor on submission of the thesis.

APPENDIX 5: ONLINE VIVA VOCE EXAMINATIONS
This appendix should be read in conjunction with the guidance provided in
‘Staff information and processes for an online viva’. All parties should
consult the guidance at least one week prior to the examination.
1. Online vivas may be overseen by an independent chair, or recorded, or both overseen by an
independent chair and recorded. The criteria for the appointment of the chair are set out in
the Framework for the Research Degree Viva (Appendix 4), as is guidance about recording the
viva.
2. The chair should ensure that:
a) all parties involved in the examination are informed in good time of the details of the
examination;
b) all parties have access to, and are familiar with the necessary technology and
contingency plans;
c) the correct process is followed for the viva;
d) the wellbeing of the candidate is attended to over the course of the viva; and
e) the recording of the examination is secured and lodged in accordance with the guidance.
Should the candidate become distressed, the chair has the authority to briefly adjourn the
examination and to speak to the candidate privately.
3. Where the department decides to record an online viva (following the clauses in Appendix 4
6.1-3 above), the candidate’s assent to this will be presumed unless they lodge a formal
objection with the department in advance of the examination. The examiners’ consent to
the recording of the viva must be obtained and confirmed on the Appointment of Research
Examiners Form. The deliberations of the examiners must not be recorded. The recording
remains the property of the University and no other recording is permitted to take place.
4. Only the University’s supported, licensed and approved software for online meetings should
be used for the purposes of conducting online vivas. Alternative software should only be
used where necessary, and as agreed in the contingency plan.
5. Any time differences between the locations must be taken into account to ensure that the
candidate is not disadvantaged by an examination taking place at a time that might
reasonably be considered to be inappropriate.
Version 1.1 53
MARP 2025-26
Postgraduate Research Regulations
6. Care must be taken to ensure that the technology used is as reliable as possible. To this end,
the equipment and software should be tested at least one week prior to the examination
using the same computers, systems, and locations (i.e. rooms) that will be used during the
examination. Contingency plans are essential in the event of technology failure.
7. The candidate’s identity must be confirmed at the beginning of the examination (e.g. by the
supervisor or by a member of professional services staff). Any materials brought into the
examination by the candidate should be identified at the outset, prior to the
commencement of the examination.
8. During the examination the examiners should normally be able to view the candidate,
although it is accepted that for certain disciplines the candidate may need to demonstrate
material on screen to the panel. Maintaining continuity of contact, however, is important
and expected throughout the viva (excluding agreed breaks).
9. The University will not normally permit any person to be present with the candidate other
than technical staff involved in the use of online communication technology or where
appropriate support arrangements have been previously agreed with disabled students.
10. Each examiner should sign (electronically) the ‘Independent Report’ and the ‘Joint Report’
and forward them to Student and Programme Administration as soon as possible after the
examination.
11. Examiners should comment on the conduct of the online examination using the standard
‘Joint Report’ form and refer explicitly to the fact that it took place under COVID-19
temporary regulations.
12. Having agreed to an online examination, the candidate will not be permitted to use this as
grounds for appeal, unless the circumstances of technical failure or other unforeseen
eventualities beyond the control of the panel were deemed to have adversely affected the
candidate’s performance and these were identified by the examiners in their joint report.
